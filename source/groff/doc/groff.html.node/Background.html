<p>M. Douglas McIlroy, formerly of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories and present at
the creation of the Unix operating system, offers an authoritative
historical summary.
</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
<p>The prime reason for Unix was the desire of Ken [Thompson], Dennis
[Ritchie], and Joe Ossanna to have a pleasant environment for software
development.  The fig leaf that got the nod from &hellip;
management was that an early use would be to develop a &ldquo;stand-alone&rdquo;
word-processing system for use in typing pools and secretarial offices.
Perhaps they had in mind &ldquo;dedicated&rdquo;, as distinct from
&ldquo;stand-alone&rdquo;; that&rsquo;s what eventuated in various cases, most notably
in the legal/patent department and in the AT&amp;T CEO&rsquo;s office.
</p>
<p>Both those systems were targets of opportunity, not foreseen from the
start.  When Unix was up and running on the PDP-11, Joe got wind of
the legal department having installed a commercial word processor.
He went to pitch Unix as an alternative and clinched a trial by
promising to make <code class="code">roff</code> able to number lines by tomorrow in order
to fulfill a patent-office requirement that the commercial system did
not support.
</p>
<p>Modems were installed so legal-department secretaries could try the
Research machine.  They liked it and Joe&rsquo;s superb customer service.
Soon the legal department got a system of their own.  Joe went on to
create <code class="code">nroff</code> and <code class="code">troff</code>.  Document preparation became a
widespread use of Unix, but no stand-alone word-processing system was
ever undertaken.
</p></blockquote>

<p>A history relating <code class="code">groff</code> to its predecessors <code class="code">roff</code>,
<code class="code">nroff</code>, and <code class="code">troff</code> is available in the <cite class="cite">roff<span class="r">(7)</span></cite>
man page.
