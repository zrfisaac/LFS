<h4 class="subsection" id="Requests-and-Macros-1">5.1.7 Requests and Macros</h4>

<p>We have now encountered almost all of the syntax there is in the
<code class="code">roff</code> language, with an exception already noted in passing.
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-request"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-control-character-_0028_002e_0029"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-character_002c-control-_0028_002e_0029"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-no_002dbreak-control-character-_0028_0027_0029"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-character_002c-no_002dbreak-control-_0028_0027_0029"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-control-character_002c-no_002dbreak-_0028_0027_0029"></a>
A <em class="dfn">request</em> is an instruction to the formatter that occurs after a
<em class="dfn">control character</em>, which is recognized at the beginning of an
input line.  The regular control character is a dot (<code class="code">.</code>).  Its
counterpart, the <em class="dfn">no-break control character</em>, a neutral apostrophe
(<code class="code">'</code>), suppresses the break that is implied by some requests.
These characters were chosen because it is uncommon for lines of text in
natural languages to begin with them.
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-dummy-character-_0028_005c_0026_0029_002c-as-control-character-suppressor"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-character_002c-dummy-_0028_005c_0026_0029_002c-as-control-character-suppressor"></a>
If you require a formatted period or apostrophe (closing single
quotation mark) where GNU <code class="code">troff</code> is expecting a control character,
prefix the dot or neutral apostrophe with the dummy character escape
sequence, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">\&amp;</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-control-line"></a>
<p>An input line beginning with a control character is called a
<em class="dfn">control line</em>.
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-text-line"></a>
Every line of input that is not a control line is a <em class="dfn">text
line</em>.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF25" href="groff.html_fot.html#FOOT25"><sup>25</sup></a>
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-argument"></a>
<p>Requests often take <em class="dfn">arguments</em>, words (separated from the request
name and each other by spaces) that specify details of the action GNU
<code class="code">troff</code> is expected to perform.  If a request is meaningless
without arguments, it is typically ignored.
</p>
<p>GNU <code class="code">troff</code>&rsquo;s requests and escape sequences comprise the control
language of the formatter.  Of key importance are the requests that
define macros.  Macros are invoked like requests, enabling the request
repertoire to be extended or overridden.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF26" href="groff.html_fot.html#FOOT26"><sup>26</sup></a>
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-macro"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-calling-a-macro"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-interpolation"></a>
<p>A <em class="dfn">macro</em> can be thought of as an abbreviation you can define for a
collection of control and text lines.  When the macro is <em class="dfn">called</em> by
giving its name after a control character, it is replaced with what it
stands for.  The process of textual replacement is known as
<em class="dfn">interpolation</em>.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF27" href="groff.html_fot.html#FOOT27"><sup>27</sup></a>  Interpolations are handled as soon as they are
recognized, and once performed, a <code class="code">roff</code> formatter scans the
replacement for further requests, macro calls, and escape sequences.
</p>
<p>In <code class="code">roff</code> systems, the <code class="code">de</code> request defines a
macro.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF28" href="groff.html_fot.html#FOOT28"><sup>28</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="example">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">.de DATE
2020-11-14
..
</pre></div></div>

<p>The foregoing input produces no output by itself; all we have done is
store some information.  Observe the pair of dots that ends the macro
definition.  This is a default; you can specify your own terminator for
the macro definition as the second argument to the <code class="code">de</code> request.
</p>
<div class="example">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">.de NAME ENDNAME
Heywood Jabuzzoff
.ENDNAME
</pre></div></div>

<p>In fact, the ending marker is itself the name of a macro to be
called, or a request to be invoked, if it is defined at the time its
control line is read.
</p>
<div class="example">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">.de END
Big Rip
..
.de START END
Big Bang
.END
.START
    &rArr; Big Rip Big Bang
</pre></div></div>

<p>In the foregoing example, &ldquo;Big Rip&rdquo; printed before &ldquo;Big Bang&rdquo;
because its macro was <em class="emph">called</em> first.  Consider what would happen
if we dropped <code class="code">END</code> from the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">.de START</samp>&rsquo; line and added
<code class="code">..</code> after <code class="code">.END</code>.  Would the order change?
</p>
<p>Let us consider a more elaborate example.
</p>
<div class="example">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">.de DATE
2020-10-05

<p>The above document started with a series of control lines.  Three macros
were defined, with a <code class="code">de</code> request declaring each macro&rsquo;s name, and
the &ldquo;body&rdquo; of the macro starting on the next line and continuing until
a line with two dots &lsquo;<samp class="samp"><code class="code">..</code></samp>&rsquo; marked its end.  The text proper
began only after the macros were defined; this is a common pattern.
Only the <code class="code">NOTICE</code> macro was called &ldquo;directly&rdquo; by the document;
<code class="code">DATE</code> and <code class="code">BOSS</code> were called only by <code class="code">NOTICE</code> itself.
Escape sequences were used in <code class="code">BOSS</code>, two levels of macro
interpolation deep.
</p>
<p>The advantage in typing and maintenance economy may not be obvious from
such a short example, but imagine a much longer document with dozens of
such paragraphs, each requiring a notice of managerial approval.
Consider what must happen if you are in charge of generating a new
version of such a document with a different date, for a different boss.
With well-chosen macros, you only have to change each datum in one
place.
</p>
<p>In practice, we would probably use strings (see <a class="pxref" href="Strings.html">Strings</a>) instead of
macros for such simple interpolations; what is important here is to
glimpse the potential of macros and the power of recursive
interpolation.
</p>
<p>We could have defined <code class="code">DATE</code> and <code class="code">BOSS</code> in the opposite order;
perhaps less obviously, we could also have defined them <em class="emph">after</em>
<code class="code">NOTICE</code>.  &ldquo;Forward references&rdquo; like this are acceptable because
the body of a macro definition is not (completely) interpreted, but
stored instead (see <a class="pxref" href="Copy-Mode.html">Copy Mode</a>).  While a macro is being defined (or
appended to), requests are not interpreted and macros not interpolated,
whereas some commonly used escape sequences <em class="emph">are</em> interpreted.
<code class="code">roff</code> systems also support recursive macro calls, as long as you
have a way to break the recursion (see <a class="pxref" href="Conditionals-and-Loops.html">Conditionals and Loops</a>).
Maintainable <code class="code">roff</code> documents tend to arrange macro definitions to
minimize forward references.
