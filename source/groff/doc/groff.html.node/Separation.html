<h4 class="subsubsection" id="Separation-1">6.1.1.1 Separation</h4>

<p><abbr class="acronym">AT&amp;T</abbr> <code class="code">troff</code> output has strange requirements regarding
whitespace.  The <code class="code">gtroff</code> output parser, however, is more tolerant,
making whitespace maximally optional.  Such characters, i.e., the tab,
space, and newline, always have a syntactical meaning.  They are never
printable because spacing within the output is always done by
positioning commands.
</p>
<p>Any sequence of space or tab characters is treated as a single
<em class="dfn">syntactical space</em>.  It separates commands and arguments, but is
only required when there would occur a clashing between the command code
and the arguments without the space.  Most often, this happens when
variable-length command names, arguments, argument lists, or command
clusters meet.  Commands and arguments with a known, fixed length need
not be separated by syntactical space.
</p>
<p>A line break is a syntactical element, too.  Every command argument can
be followed by whitespace, a comment, or a newline character.  Thus a
<em class="dfn">syntactical line break</em> is defined to consist of optional
syntactical space that is optionally followed by a comment, and a
newline character.
</p>
<p>The normal commands, those for positioning and text, consist of a single
letter taking a fixed number of arguments.  For historical reasons, the
parser allows stacking of such commands on the same line, but
fortunately, in <code class="code">gtroff</code>&rsquo;s intermediate output, every command with
at least one argument is followed by a line break, thus providing
excellent readability.
</p>
<p>The other commands&mdash;those for drawing and device controlling&mdash;have a
more complicated structure; some recognize long command names, and some
take a variable number of arguments.  So all &lsquo;<samp class="samp">D</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">x</samp>&rsquo;
commands were designed to request a syntactical line break after their
last argument.  Only one command, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">x&nbsp;X</samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->, has an argument that
can span several input lines; all other commands must have all of
their arguments on the same line as the command, i.e., the arguments may
not be split by a line break.
</p>
<p>Empty lines (these are lines containing only space and/or a comment),
can occur everywhere.  They are just ignored.
