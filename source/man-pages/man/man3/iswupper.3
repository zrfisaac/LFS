.SH NAME
iswupper \- test for uppercase wide character
.SH LIBRARY
Standard C library
.RI ( libc ", " \-lc )
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wctype.h>
.P
.BI "int iswupper(wint_t " wc );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR iswupper ()
function is the wide-character equivalent of the
.BR isupper (3)
function.
It tests whether
.I wc
is a wide character
belonging to the wide-character class "upper".
.P
The wide-character class "upper" is a subclass of the wide-character class
"alpha", and therefore also a subclass of the wide-character class "alnum", of
the wide-character class "graph" and of the wide-character class "print".
.P
Being a subclass of the wide-character class "print", the wide-character class
"upper" is disjoint from the wide-character class "cntrl".
.P
Being a subclass of the wide-character class "graph", the wide-character class
"upper" is disjoint from the wide-character class "space" and its subclass
"blank".
.P
Being a subclass of the wide-character class "alnum", the wide-character class
"upper" is disjoint from the wide-character class "punct".
.P
Being a subclass of the wide-character class "alpha", the wide-character class
"upper" is disjoint from the wide-character class "digit".
.P
The wide-character class "upper" contains at least those characters
.I wc
which are equal to
.I towupper(wc)
and different from
.IR towlower(wc) .
.P
The wide-character class "upper" always contains at least the
letters \[aq]A\[aq] to \[aq]Z\[aq].
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR iswupper ()
function returns nonzero if
.I wc
is a wide character
belonging to the wide-character class "upper".
Otherwise, it returns zero.

.SH NOTES
The behavior of
.BR iswupper ()
depends on the
.B LC_CTYPE
category of the
current locale.
.P
This function is not very appropriate for dealing with Unicode characters,
because Unicode knows about three cases: upper, lower, and title case.
