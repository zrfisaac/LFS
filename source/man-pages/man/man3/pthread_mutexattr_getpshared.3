process-shared mutex attribute
.SH LIBRARY

.SH SYNOPSIS

.P
.B int pthread_mutexattr_getpshared(
.BI "                      const pthread_mutexattr_t *restrict " attr ,

.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions get and set the process-shared attribute
in a mutex attributes object.
This attribute must be appropriately set to ensure correct,
efficient operation of a mutex created using this attributes object.
.P
The process-shared attribute can have one of the following values:
.TP
.B PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE
Mutexes created with this attributes object are to be shared
only among threads in the same process that initialized the mutex.
This is the default value for the process-shared mutex attribute.
.TP
.B PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED
Mutexes created with this attributes object can be shared between
any threads that have access to the memory containing the object,
including threads in different processes.
.P
.BR pthread_mutexattr_getpshared ()
places the value of the process-shared attribute of
the mutex attributes object referred to by
.I attr
in the location pointed to by
.IR pshared .
.P
.BR pthread_mutexattr_setpshared ()
sets the value of the process-shared attribute of
the mutex attributes object referred to by
.I attr
to the value specified in
.BR pshared .
.P
If
.I attr
does not refer to an initialized mutex attributes object,
the behavior is undefined.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these functions return 0.
On error, they return a positive error number.
.SH ERRORS
.BR pthread_mutexattr_setpshared ()
can fail with the following errors:
.TP
.B EINVAL
The value specified in
.I pshared
is invalid.
.TP
.B ENOTSUP
.I pshared is
.B PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED
but the implementation does not support process-shared mutexes.
