Name
        Lint - instructions for linting manual pages

Description
    The entire project
        To run the linters and checks for the entire project, run

            $ make lint build check;

        This skips tests that are known to fail.  To run those too, run

            $ make lint build check SKIP_XFAIL=no;

    A single page
        To run those for a single page, you can take advantage of some
        make(1) features:

        (1)  First use make(1)'s -t option, so that make(1) knows that
             it only needs to lint & check again pages that you will
             touch.

                 $ make -t lint build check;

        (2)  Run make(1) again, asking it to imagine that the page
             you're interested in has been touched.

                 $ # replace 'man2/membarrier.2' by any page.
                 $ make -W man2/membarrier.2 -k lint build check;

    Dependencies
        See <INSTALL> for a list of dependencies that this feature
        requires.  If you can't meet them all, don't worry; it will still
        run the linters and checks that you have available.
