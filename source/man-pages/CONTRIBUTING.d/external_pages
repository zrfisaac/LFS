Name
       External pages - pages imported or generated from other projects

Description
       A few pages come from external sources.  Fixes to the pages
       should really go to the upstream source.

       tzfile(5), tzselect(8), zdump(8), and zic(8) come from the tz
       project <https://www.iana.org/time-zones>.

       bpf-helpers(7) is autogenerated from the Linux kernel sources
       using scripts.  See man-pages commits 53666f6c3 and 19c7f7839 for
       details.
