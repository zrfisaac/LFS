Name
       Bugs - instructions for reporting bugs

Description
       Report bugs to the mailing list.  If you can write a patch, it's
       very welcome.

       If you're unsure if the bug is in the manual page or in the code
       being documented (kernel, glibc, ...), it's best to send the
       report to both at the same time, that is, CC all the mailing
       lists that may be concerned by the report.

       Some distributions (for example Debian) apply patches to the
       upstream manual pages.  If you suspect the bug is in one of those
       patches, report it to your distribution maintainer.

       Send logically separate reports.  For unrelated pages, or for
       logically-separate issues in the same page, send separate emails.

       There's also a bugzilla, but we don't use it as much as the
       mailing list.  If you want to track your bug there, feel free to
       open a bug report, but expect more attention in the mailing list.
