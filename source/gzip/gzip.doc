1mNAME0m
       gzip, gunzip, zcat - compress or expand files

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mgzip 22m[ 1m-acdfhklLnNrtvV19 22m] [1m-S suffix22m] [ 4mname24m 4m...24m  ]
       1mgunzip 22m[ 1m-acfhklLnNrtvV 22m] [1m-S suffix22m] [ 4mname24m 4m...24m  ]
       1mzcat 22m[ 1m-fhLV 22m] [ 4mname24m 4m...24m  ]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The  1mgzip  22mcommand reduces the size of the named files using Lempel-Ziv
       coding (LZ77).  Whenever possible, each file is replaced	 by  one  with
       the  extension  1m.gz22m, while keeping the same ownership modes, access and
       modification times.  (The default extension is 1mz 22mfor MSDOS,	 OS/2  FAT,
       Windows	NT  FAT	 and  Atari.)  If no files are specified, or if a file
       name is "-", the standard input is compressed to the  standard  output.
       The  1mgzip 22mcommand will only attempt to compress regular files.  In par-
       ticular, it will ignore symbolic links.

       If the compressed file name is too long for its file system, 1mgzip 22mtrun-
       cates  it.  The 1mgzip 22mcommand attempts to truncate only the parts of the
       file name longer than 3 characters.  (A part is delimited by dots.)  If
       the name consists of small parts only, the longest parts are truncated.
       For example, if file names are limited to 14 characters, gzip.msdos.exe
       is  compressed  to  gzi.msd.exe.gz.  Names are not truncated on systems
       which do not have a limit on file name length.

       By default, 1mgzip 22mkeeps the original file name and timestamp in the com-
       pressed	file.	These are used when decompressing the file with the 1m-N0m
       option.	This is useful when the compressed file name was truncated  or
       when the timestamp was not preserved after a file transfer.

       Compressed  files  can be restored to their original form using 1mgzip -d0m
       or 1mgunzip 22mor 1mzcat22m.  If the original name saved in the	compressed  file
       is not suitable for its file system, a new name is constructed from the
       original one to make it valid.

       1mgunzip 22mtakes a list of files on its command line and replaces each file
       whose  name ends with .gz, -gz, .z, -z, or _z (ignoring case) and which
       begins with the correct magic number with an uncompressed file  without
       the  original extension.	 1mgunzip 22malso recognizes the special extensions
       1m.tgz 22mand 1m.taz 22mas shorthands for 1m.tar.gz 22mand 1m.tar.Z 22mrespectively.   When
       compressing, 1mgzip 22muses the 1m.tgz 22mextension if necessary instead of trun-
       cating a file with a 1m.tar 22mextension.

       1mgunzip 22mcan currently decompress files created by 1mgzip22m,	 1mzip22m,  1mcompress22m,
       1mcompress  -H  22mor 1mpack22m.	 The detection of the input format is automatic.
       When using the first two formats, 1mgunzip 22mchecks a 32 bit CRC.  For 1mpack0m
       and  1mgunzip 22mchecks the uncompressed length.	 The standard 1mcompress 22mfor-
       mat was not designed to allow consistency checks.   However  1mgunzip  22mis
       sometimes  able	to detect a bad .Z file.  If you get an error when un-
       compressing a .Z file, do not assume that the .Z file is correct simply
       because	the  standard  1muncompress  22mdoes  not complain.  This generally
       means that the standard 1muncompress 22mdoes not check its input,  and  hap-
       pily  generates	garbage	 output.  The SCO compress -H format (lzh com-
       pression method) does not include a CRC but also	 allows	 some  consis-
       tency checks.

       Files  created  by  1mzip 22mcan be uncompressed by gzip only if they have a
       single member compressed with the 'deflation' method.  This feature  is
       only intended to help conversion of tar.zip files to the tar.gz format.
       To extract a 1mzip 22mfile with a single member, use a command like  '1mgunzip0m
       1m<foo.zip22m'  or '1mgunzip -S .zip foo.zip22m'.  To extract zip files with sev-
       eral members, use 1munzip 22minstead of 1mgunzip22m.

       The 1mzcat 22mcommand is identical to 1mgunzip -c22m.  (On some systems, 1mzcat 22mmay
       be installed as 1mgzcat 22mto preserve the original link to 1mcompress22m.)  1mzcat0m
       uncompresses either a list of files on the command line or its standard
       input  and  writes the uncompressed data on standard output.  1mzcat 22mwill
       uncompress files that have the correct magic number whether they have a
       1m.gz 22msuffix or not.

       The  1mgzip  22mcommand uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm used in 1mzip 22mand PKZIP.
       The amount of compression obtained depends on the size of the input and
       the  distribution of common substrings.	Typically, text such as source
       code or English is reduced by 60-70%.  Compression  is  generally  much
       better  than that achieved by LZW (as used in 1mcompress22m), Huffman coding
       (as used in 1mpack22m), or adaptive Huffman coding (1mcompact22m).

       Compression is  always  performed,  even	 if  the  compressed  file  is
       slightly	 larger	 than the original.  The worst case expansion is a few
       bytes for the gzip file header, plus 5 bytes per 32 KiB	block,	or  an
       expansion  ratio	 of 0.015% for large files.  The actual number of used
       disk blocks almost never increases.

       1mgzip 22mnormally preserves the mode and modification timestamp of  a  file
       when compressing or decompressing.  If you have appropriate privileges,
       it also preserves the file's owner and group.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-a --ascii0m
	      Ascii text mode: convert end-of-lines using  local  conventions.
	      This option is supported only on some non-Unix systems.  For MS-
	      DOS, CR LF is converted to LF when compressing, and LF  is  con-
	      verted to CR LF when decompressing.

       1m-c --stdout --to-stdout0m
	      Write  output on standard output; keep original files unchanged.
	      If there are several input files, the output consists of	a  se-
	      quence  of  independently	 compressed members.  To obtain better
	      compression, concatenate	all  input  files  before  compressing
	      them.

       1m-d --decompress --uncompress0m
	      Decompress.

       1m-f --force0m
	      Force compression or decompression even if the file has multiple
	      links or the corresponding file already exists, or if  the  com-
	      pressed  data is read from or written to a terminal.  If the in-
	      put data is not in a format recognized by 1mgzip22m, and if  the	op-
	      tion  --stdout is also given, copy the input data without change
	      to the standard output: let 1mzcat 22mbehave as 1mcat22m.	 If  1m-f  22mis  not
	      given,  and  when not running in the background, 1mgzip 22mprompts to
	      verify whether an existing file should be overwritten.

       1m-h --help0m
	      Display a help screen and quit.

       1m-k --keep0m
	      Keep (don't delete) input files during compression or decompres-
	      sion.

       1m-l --list0m
	      For each compressed file, list the following fields:

		  compressed size: size of the compressed file
		  uncompressed size: size of the uncompressed file
		  ratio: compression ratio (0.0% if unknown)
		  uncompressed_name: name of the uncompressed file

	      The  uncompressed size is given as -1 for files not in gzip for-
	      mat, such as compressed .Z files.	 To get the uncompressed  size
	      for such a file, you can use:

		  zcat file.Z | wc -c

	      In  combination  with the --verbose option, the following fields
	      are also displayed:

		  method: compression method
		  crc: the 32-bit CRC of the uncompressed data
		  date & time: timestamp for the uncompressed file

	      The compression methods currently supported  are	deflate,  com-
	      press,  lzh  (SCO	 compress  -H)	and pack.  The crc is given as
	      ffffffff for a file not in gzip format.

	      With --name, the uncompressed name,  date and  time   are	 those
	      stored within the compress file if present.

	      With  --verbose,	the  size totals and compression ratio for all
	      files is also displayed, unless some sizes  are  unknown.	  With
	      --quiet, the title and totals lines are not displayed.

       1m-L --license0m
	      Display the 1mgzip 22mlicense and quit.

       1m-n --no-name0m
	      When  compressing,  do not save the original file name and time-
	      stamp by default.	 (The original name is	always	saved  if  the
	      name  had	 to be truncated.)  When decompressing, do not restore
	      the original file name if present (remove only the  1mgzip  22msuffix
	      from  the	 compressed file name) and do not restore the original
	      timestamp if present (copy it from the compressed	 file).	  This
	      option is the default when decompressing.

       1m-N --name0m
	      When  compressing,  always save the original file name, and save
	      the seconds part of the original modification timestamp  if  the
	      original	is  a  regular	file  and  its timestamp is at least 1
	      (1970-01-01 00:00:01 UTC) and is	less  than  2**32  (2106-02-07
	      06:28:16	UTC,  assuming	leap seconds are not counted); this is
	      the default.  When decompressing, restore from  the  saved  file
	      name and timestamp if present.  This option is useful on systems
	      which have a limit on file name length or when the timestamp has
	      been lost after a file transfer.

       1m-q --quiet0m
	      Suppress all warnings.

       1m-r --recursive0m
	      Travel  the directory structure recursively.  If any of the file
	      names specified on the command line are directories,  1mgzip  22mwill
	      descend  into  the directory and compress all the files it finds
	      there (or decompress them in the case of 1mgunzip 22m).

       1m-S .suf --suffix .suf0m
	      When compressing, use suffix .suf instead of .gz.	 Any non-empty
	      suffix  can  be given, but suffixes other than .z and .gz should
	      be avoided to avoid confusion  when  files  are  transferred  to
	      other systems.

	      When  decompressing,  add	 .suf  to the beginning of the list of
	      suffixes to try, when deriving an output file name from an input
	      file name.

       1m--synchronous0m
	      Use  synchronous	output.	 With this option, 1mgzip 22mis less likely
	      to lose data during a system crash, but it can  be  considerably
	      slower.

       1m-t --test0m
	      Test.  Check the compressed file integrity then quit.

       1m-v --verbose0m
	      Verbose.	 Display  the  name  and percentage reduction for each
	      file compressed or decompressed.

       1m-V --version0m
	      Version.	Display the version  number  and  compilation  options
	      then quit.

       1m-# --fast --best0m
	      Regulate	the  speed of compression using the specified digit 1m#22m,
	      where 1m-1 22mor 1m--fast	 22mindicates  the  fastest  compression  method
	      (less  compression)  and 1m-9 22mor 1m--best 22mindicates the slowest com-
	      pression method (best  compression).   The  default  compression
	      level is 1m-6 22m(that is, biased towards high compression at expense
	      of speed).

       1m--rsyncable0m
	      When you synchronize a compressed file  between  two  computers,
	      this  option  allows  rsync  to  transfer	 only  files that were
	      changed in the archive instead of the entire archive.  Normally,
	      after  a change is made to any file in the archive, the compres-
	      sion algorithm can generate a new version of  the	 archive  that
	      does  not	 match	the  previous version of the archive.  In this
	      case, rsync transfers the entire new version of the  archive  to
	      the  remote computer.  With this option, rsync can transfer only
	      the changed files as well as a small amount of metadata that  is
	      required	to  update  the archive structure in the area that was
	      changed.

1mADVANCED USAGE0m
       Multiple compressed files can be concatenated.  In  this	 case,	1mgunzip0m
       will extract all members at once.  For example:

	     gzip -c file1  > foo.gz
	     gzip -c file2 >> foo.gz

       Then

	     gunzip -c foo

       is equivalent to

	     cat file1 file2

       In  case of damage to one member of a .gz file, other members can still
       be recovered (if the damaged member is removed).	 However, you can  get
       better compression by compressing all members at once:

	     cat file1 file2 | gzip > foo.gz

       compresses better than

	     gzip -c file1 file2 > foo.gz

       If you want to recompress concatenated files to get better compression,
       do:

	     gzip -cd old.gz | gzip > new.gz

       If a compressed file consists of several members, the uncompressed size
       and  CRC reported by the --list option applies to the last member only.
       If you need the uncompressed size for all members, you can use:

	     gzip -cd file.gz | wc -c

       If you wish to create a single archive file with	 multiple  members  so
       that members can later be extracted independently, use an archiver such
       as tar or zip.  GNU tar supports the -z option to invoke gzip transpar-
       ently.  gzip is designed as a complement to tar, not as a replacement.

1mENVIRONMENT0m
       The obsolescent environment variable 1mGZIP 22mcan hold a set of default op-
       tions for 1mgzip22m.  These options are interpreted first and can  be  over-
       written	by  explicit command line parameters.  As this can cause prob-
       lems when using scripts, this feature is	 supported  only  for  options
       that  are  reasonably likely to not cause too much harm, and 1mgzip 22mwarns
       if it is used.  This feature will be removed in	a  future  release  of
       1mgzip22m.

       You can use an alias or script instead.	For example, if 1mgzip 22mis in the
       directory 1m/usr/bin 22myou can prepend 1m$HOME/bin 22mto your 1mPATH 22mand create an
       executable script 1m$HOME/bin/gzip 22mcontaining the following:

	     #! /bin/sh
	     export PATH=/usr/bin
	     exec gzip -9 "$@"

1mDIAGNOSTICS0m
       Exit status is normally 0; if an error occurs, exit status is 1.	 If  a
       warning occurs, exit status is 2.

       Usage: gzip [-cdfhklLnNrtvV19] [-S suffix] [file ...]
	      Invalid options were specified on the command line.

       4mfile24m: not in gzip format
	      The file specified to 1mgunzip 22mhas not been compressed.

       4mfile24m: Corrupt input.
	      Use  zcat	 to  recover  some data.  The compressed file has been
	      damaged.	The data up to the point of failure can	 be  recovered
	      using

		    zcat 4mfile24m > recover

       4mfile24m: compressed with 4mxx24m bits, can only handle 4myy24m bits
	      1mFile  22mwas  compressed  (using  LZW) by a program that could deal
	      with more bits than the decompress code on this machine.	Recom-
	      press  the file with gzip, which compresses better and uses less
	      memory.

       4mfile24m: already has .gz suffix -- unchanged
	      The file is assumed to be already compressed.  Rename  the  file
	      and try again.

       4mfile24m already exists; do you wish to overwrite (y or n)?
	      Respond  "y"  if you want the output file to be replaced; "n" if
	      not.

       gunzip: corrupt input
	      A SIGSEGV violation was detected which usually  means  that  the
	      input file has been corrupted.

       4mxx.x%24m Percentage of the input saved by compression.
	      (Relevant only for 1m-v 22mand 1m-l22m.)

       -- not a regular file or directory: ignored
	      When the input file is not a regular file or directory, (e.g., a
	      symbolic link, socket, FIFO, device file), it is left unaltered.

       -- has 4mxx24m other links: unchanged
	      The input file has links; it is left unchanged.  See  1mln22m(1)	for
	      more  information.  Use the 1m-f 22mflag to force compression of mul-
	      tiply-linked files.

1mCAVEATS0m
       When writing compressed data to a tape, it is  generally	 necessary  to
       pad  the	 output	 with zeroes up to a block boundary.  When the data is
       read and the whole block is passed to 1mgunzip 22mfor decompression,  1mgunzip0m
       detects	that there is extra trailing garbage after the compressed data
       and emits a warning by default.	You can use the --quiet option to sup-
       press the warning.

1mBUGS0m
       In  some rare cases, the --best option gives worse compression than the
       default compression level (-6).	On some highly redundant  files,  1mcom-0m
       1mpress 22mcompresses better than 1mgzip22m.
