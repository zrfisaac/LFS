== NAME

lastlog2 - display date of last login for all users or a specific one

== SYNOPSIS

*lastlog2* [options]

== DESCRIPTION


*lastlog2* displays the content of the last login database. The _login-name_,
_last-login-time_, _tty_ and _remote-host_ will be printed.
The default (no flags) causes all last login entries to be printed, sorted
by the order as written the first time into the database.

Compared to *lastlog* this command is Y2038 safe and uses sqlite3 to store the
information and not a sparse file.
