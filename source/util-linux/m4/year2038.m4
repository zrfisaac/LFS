# C code used to probe for time_t that can represent time points more
# than 2**31 - 1 seconds after the epoch.  With the usual Unix epoch,
# these correspond to dates after 2038-01-18 22:14:07 +0000 (Gregorian),
# hence the name.

# Subroutine of AC_SYS_YEAR2038.  Probe for time_t that can represent
# time points more than 2**31 - 1 seconds after the epoch (dates after
# 2038-01-18, see above) and set the cache variable ac_cv_sys_year2038_opts
# to one of the values in the _AC_SYS_YEAR2038_OPTIONS list, or to
# "support not detected" if none of them worked.  Then, set compilation
# options and #defines as necessary to enable large time_t support.
#
# Note that we do not test whether mktime, localtime, etc. handle
# large values of time_t correctly, as that would require use of
# AC_TRY_RUN.  Note also that some systems only support large time_t
# together with large off_t.
#
# If you change this macro you may also need to change
# _AC_SYS_YEAR2038_OPTIONS.
