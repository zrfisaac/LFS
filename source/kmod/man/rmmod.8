.SH NAME

rmmod - Simple program to remove a module from the Linux Kernel
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBrmmod\fR [\fB-f\fR] [\fB-s\fR] [\fB-v\fR] [\fImodulename\fR]
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBrmmod\fR is a trivial program to remove a module (when module unloading support
is provided) from the kernel.\& Most users will want to use \fBmodprobe\fR(8) with the
\fB-r\fR option instead since it removes unused dependent modules as well.\&
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB-v\fR
\fB--verbose\fR
.RS 4
Print messages about what the program is doing.\& Usually \fBrmmod\fR prints
messages only if something goes wrong.\&
.PP
.RE
\fB-f\fR
\fB--force\fR
.RS 4
This option can be extremely dangerous: it has no effect unless
CONFIG_MODULE_FORCE_UNLOAD was set when the kernel was compiled.\& With
this option, you can remove modules which are being used, or which are
not designed to be removed, or have been marked as unsafe (see \fBlsmod\fR(8)).\&
.PP
.RE
\fB-s\fR
\fB--syslog\fR
.RS 4
Send errors to syslog instead of standard error.\&
.PP
.RE
\fB-V\fR
\fB--version\fR
.RS 4
Show version of program and exit.\&
