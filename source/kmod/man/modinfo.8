.SH NAME
.PP
modinfo - Show information about a Linux Kernel module
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBmodinfo\fR [\fB-0\fR] [\fB-F\fR \fIfield\fR] [\fB-k\fR \fIkernel\fR] [modulename|filename.\&.\&.\&]
.PP
\fBmodinfo\fR \fB-V\fR
.PP
\fBmodinfo\fR \fB-h\fR
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBmodinfo\fR extracts information from the Linux Kernel modules given on the
command line.\& If the module name is not a filename, then the /lib/modules/
\fIversion\fR directory is searched, as is also done by \fBmodprobe\fR(8) when loading
kernel modules.\&
.PP
\fBmodinfo\fR by default lists each attribute of the module in form \fIfieldname\fR :
\fIvalue\fR, for easy reading.\& The filename is listed the same way (although it'\&s
not really an attribute).\&
.PP
This version of \fBmodinfo\fR can understand modules of any Linux Kernel
architecture.\&
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB-V\fR
\fB--version\fR
.RS 4
Print the \fBmodinfo\fR version.\&
.PP
.RE
\fB-F\fR \fIfield\fR
\fB--field\fR \fIfield\fR
.RS 4
Only print this \fIfield\fR value, one per line.\& This is most useful for
scripts.\& Field names are case-insensitive.\& Common fields (which may not
be in every module) include author, description, license, parm, depends,
and alias.\& There are often multiple parm, alias and depends fields.\& The
special \fIfield\fR filename lists the filename of the module.\&
.PP
.RE
\fB-b\fR \fIbasedir\fR
\fB--basedir\fR \fIbasedir\fR
.RS 4
Root directory for modules, / by default.\&
.PP
.RE
\fB-k\fR \fIkernel\fR
.RS 4
Provide information about a kernel other than the running one.\& This is
particularly useful for distributions needing to extract information
from a newly installed (but not yet running) set of kernel modules.\& For
example, you wish to find which firmware files are needed by various
modules in a new kernel for which you must make an initrd/initramfs
image prior to booting.\&
.PP
.RE
\fB-0\fR
\fB--null\fR
.RS 4
Use the ASCII zero character to separate \fIfield\fR values, instead of a new
line.\& This is useful for scripts, since a new line can theoretically
appear inside a \fIfield\fR.\&
.PP
.RE
\fB-a\fR \fB--author\fR
\fB-d\fR \fB--description\fR
\fB-l\fR \fB--license\fR
\fB-p\fR \fB--parameters\fR
\fB-n\fR \fB--filename\fR
.RS 4
These are shortcuts for the \fB--field\fR flag'\&s author, description,
license, parm and filename arguments, to ease the transition from the
old modutils \fBmodinfo\fR.\&
