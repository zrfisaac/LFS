.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
On execution \fBdepmod\fR reads the configuration files from the above location and
based on that it processes the available modules and their dependencies.\& For
example: one can change the search order, exclude folders, override specific
module'\&s location and more.\&
.PP
This is typically useful in cases where built-in kernel modules are complemented
by custom built versions of the same and the user wishes to affect the priority
of processing in order to override the module version supplied by the kernel.\&
.PP
.SH CONFIGURATION FORMAT
.PP
The configuration files contain one command per line, with blank lines and lines
starting with '\&#'\& ignored (useful for adding comments).\& A '\&\e'\& at the end of a
line causes it to continue on the next line, which makes the files a bit neater.\&
.PP
See the COMMANDS section below for more.\&
.PP
.SH CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE
.PP
Configuration files are read from directories in listed in SYNOPSYS in that
order of precedence.\& Once a file of a given filename is loaded, any file of the
same name in subsequent directories is ignored.\&
.PP
All configuration files are sorted in lexicographic order, regardless of the
directory they reside in.\& Configuration files can either be completely replaced
(by having a new configuration file with the same name in a directory of higher
priority) or partially replaced (by having a configuration file that is ordered
later).\&
.PP
.SH COMMANDS
.PP
search \fIsubdirectory.\&.\&.\&\fR
.RS 4
This allows you to specify the order in which /lib/modules (or
other configured module location) subdirectories will be processed by
\fBdepmod\fR.\& Directories are listed in order, with the highest priority
given to the first listed directory and the lowest priority given to the
last directory listed.\& The special keyword \fBbuilt-in\fR refers to the
standard module directories installed by the kernel.\& Another special
keyword \fBexternal\fR refers to the list of external directories, defined
by the \fBexternal\fR command.\&
.PP
By default, depmod will give a higher priority to a directory with the
name \fBupdates\fR using this built-in search string: "updates built-in" but
more complex arrangements are possible and are used in several popular
distributions.\&
.PP
.RE
override \fImodulename\fR \fIkernelversion\fR \fImodulesubdirectory\fR
.RS 4
This command allows you to override which version of a specific module
will be used when more than one module sharing the same name is
processed by the \fBdepmod\fR command.\& It is possible to specify one kernel
or all kernels using the * wildcard.\& \fImodulesubdirectory\fR is the name
of the subdirectory under /lib/modules (or other module location)
where the target module is installed.\&
.PP
For example, it is possible to override the priority of an updated test
module called \fBkmod\fR by specifying the following command: "override
kmod * extra".\& This will ensure that any matching module name installed
under the \fBextra\fR subdirectory within /lib/modules (or other
module location) will take priority over any likenamed module already
provided by the kernel.\&
.PP
.RE
external \fIkernelversion\fR \fIabsolutemodulesdirectory.\&.\&.\&\fR
.RS 4
This specifies a list of directories, which will be checked according to
the priorities in the \fBsearch\fR command.\& The order matters also, the
first directory has the higher priority.\&
.PP
The \fIkernelversion\fR is a POSIX regular expression or * wildcard, like
in the \fBoverride\fR.\&
.PP
.RE
exclude \fIexcludedir\fR
.RS 4
This specifies the trailing directories that will be excluded during the
search for kernel modules.\&
.PP
The \fIexcludedir\fR is the trailing directory to exclude.\&
