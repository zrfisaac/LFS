/lib/modules/modules.\&dep.\&bin
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBmodules.\&dep.\&bin\fR is a binary file generated by \fBdepmod\fR listing the
dependencies for every module in the directories under
/lib/modules/\fIversion\fR.\& It is used by \fBkmod\fR tools such as \fBmodprobe\fR and
libkmod.\&
.PP
Its text counterpart is located in the same directory with the name
\fBmodules.\&dep\fR.\& The text version is maintained only for easy of reading by humans
and is in no way used by any \fBkmod\fR tool.\&
.PP
These files are not intended for editing or use by any additional utilities as
their format is subject to change in the future.\& You should use the \fBmodinfo\fR(8)
command to obtain information about modules in a future proof and compatible
fashion rather than touching these files.\&
