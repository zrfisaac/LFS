Allows a process to freely manipulate its inheritable
capabilities.

Linux supports the POSIX.1e Inheritable set, the POXIX.1e (X
vector) known in Linux as the Bounding vector, as well as
the Linux extension Ambient vector.

This capability permits dropping bits from the Bounding
vector (ie. raising B bits in the libcap IAB
representation). It also permits the process to raise
Ambient vector bits that are both raised in the Permitted
and Inheritable sets of the process. This capability cannot
be used to raise Permitted bits, Effective bits beyond those
already present in the process' permitted set, or
Inheritable bits beyond those present in the Bounding
vector.

[Historical note: prior to the advent of file capabilities
(2008), this capability was suppressed by default, as its
unsuppressed behavior was not auditable: it could
asynchronously grant its own Permitted capabilities to and
remove capabilities from other processes arbitrarily. The
former leads to undefined behavior, and the latter is better
served by the kill system call.]
