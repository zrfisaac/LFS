Allows a process to perform operations on files, even
where file owner ID should otherwise need be equal to
the UID, except where CAP_FSETID is applicable. It
doesn't override MAC and DAC restrictions.

This capability permits the deletion of a file owned
by another UID in a directory protected by the sticky
(t) bit.
