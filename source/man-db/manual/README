This directory contains the man-db manual sources.  They may be compiled into
five different formats:

	dvi:	device independent
	ps:	PostScript
	cat:	vt100-type terminal ie. ASCII with overstrike
	tps:	PostScript with TeX fonts
	html:	HyperText Markup Language

All require soelim, tbl and the ROFF macro `e' (your site probably has it).
cat requires nroff whereas the others require groff.  tps also requires an
installation of TeX and dvips.  html requires a version of groff with the
grohtml driver, and is currently disabled by default as the output is
suboptimal.

Issuing `make' or `make all' will produce the dvi, ps and cat versions.  To
produce a single format simply run

	make <format>
or
	make man_db.<format>

where <format> can be any of the above.
