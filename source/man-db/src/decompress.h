 * files, and allows us to emulate streaming without having to resort to
 * subprocesses, threads, or coroutines.  However, there are some cases
 * (notably encoding conversion) where it's useful to be able to do some
 * kind of processing on the file contents in a way that similarly looks
 * like streaming to its consumers.  To allow for this, we allow consumers
 * of decompressed data to replace the buffered file contents and reset the
 * read offset so that their consumers in turn get the same useful read/peek
 * API.
 *
 * This is of course a hack, and wouldn't be a wise thing to include in a
 * general-purpose library API, but this is only used within man-db.
