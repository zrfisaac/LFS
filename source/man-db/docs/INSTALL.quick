Full installation details are included in ../README.md.  If you are simply
upgrading an old version of man-db and know that all of the defaults
are correct (your config file will NOT be overwritten), you may follow
the Quick install below.

man-db requires several external packages:

	* libpipeline >= 1.5.0 (https://libpipeline.gitlab.io/libpipeline/)
	* flex >= 2.5.30 (https://github.com/westes/flex)
	* a database library, one of:
	  GDBM (https://www.gnu.org.ua/software/gdbm/)
	  Berkeley DB < 6
	  NDBM

and on systems without GNU libc:

	* libiconv >= 1.8 (https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/)

Some other packages are recommended and used if available:

	* zlib (https://zlib.net/)
	* libseccomp (https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp)

Quick INSTALL
=============

	* RUN `./configure <appropriate flags>'
	* EDIT configuration files/headers if necessary
	* RUN `make <appropriate variable definitions>'
	* RUN `make install <appropriate variable definitions>'

Note (1): If you don't know what <appropriate flags> or <appropriate
variable definitions> mean, you should be reading/following the install
procedure in ../README.md instead.

Note (2): You must not replace the `make install' step by copying the
binaries to wherever you may want them.  Various paths are hard coded
into the binaries during `make' and unless you know exactly what you
are doing, it is likely that run time errors will occur.

Note (3): If you run make with path/prefix/name_transformation variable
definitions such as `make prefix=/tmp zsoelim=soelim', you must supply
the same variable definitions to `make install'.  In general it is
better to run `./configure' with the appropriate options rather than
waiting until the make stage of the build.
