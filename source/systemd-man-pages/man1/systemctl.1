\fBlist\-units\fR [\fIPATTERN\fR\&...]
.RS 4
List units that
\fBsystemd\fR
currently has in memory\&. This includes units that are either referenced directly or through a dependency, units that are pinned by applications programmatically, or units that were active in the past and have failed\&. By default only units which are active, have pending jobs, or have failed are shown; this can be changed with option
\fB\-\-all\fR\&. If one or more
\fIPATTERN\fRs are specified, only units matching one of them are shown\&. The units that are shown are additionally filtered by
\fB\-\-type=\fR
and
\fB\-\-state=\fR
if those options are specified\&.
.sp
Note that this command does not show unit templates, but only instances of unit templates\&. Units templates that aren\*(Aqt instantiated are not runnable, and will thus never show up in the output of this command\&. Specifically this means that
foo@\&.service
will never be shown in this list \(em unless instantiated, e\&.g\&. as
foo@bar\&.service\&. Use
\fBlist\-unit\-files\fR
(see below) for listing installed unit template files\&.

\fBstatus\fR [\fIPATTERN\fR\&...|\fIPID\fR\&...]]
.RS 4
Show runtime status information about the whole system or about one or more units followed by most recent log data from the journal\&. If no positional arguments are specified, and no unit filter is given with
\fB\-\-type=\fR,
\fB\-\-state=\fR, or
\fB\-\-failed\fR, shows the status of the whole system\&. If combined with
\fB\-\-all\fR, follows that with the status of all units\&. If positional arguments are specified, each positional argument is treated as either a unit name to show, or a glob pattern to show units whose names match that pattern, or a PID to show the unit containing that PID\&. When
\fB\-\-type=\fR,
\fB\-\-state=\fR, or
\fB\-\-failed\fR
are used, units are additionally filtered by the TYPE and ACTIVE state\&.
.sp
This function is intended to generate human\-readable output\&. If you are looking for computer\-parsable output, use
\fBshow\fR
instead\&. By default, this function only shows 10 lines of output and ellipsizes lines to fit in the terminal window\&. This can be changed with
\fB\-\-lines\fR
and
\fB\-\-full\fR, see above\&. In addition,
\fBjournalctl \-\-unit=\fR\fB\fINAME\fR\fR
or
\fBjournalctl \-\-user\-unit=\fR\fB\fINAME\fR\fR
use a similar filter for messages and might be more convenient\&.
.sp
Note that this operation only displays
\fIruntime\fR
status, i\&.e\&. information about the current invocation of the unit (if it is running) or the most recent invocation (if it is not running anymore, and has not been released from memory)\&. Information about earlier invocations, invocations from previous system boots, or prior invocations that have already been released from memory may be retrieved via
\fBjournalctl \-\-unit=\fR\&.
.sp
systemd implicitly loads units as necessary, so just running the
\fBstatus\fR
will attempt to load a file\&. The command is thus not useful for determining if something was already loaded or not\&. The units may possibly also be quickly unloaded after the operation is completed if there\*(Aqs no reason to keep it in memory thereafter\&.

The dot ("●") uses color on supported terminals to summarize the unit state at a glance\&. Along with its color, its shape varies according to its state:
"inactive"
or
"maintenance"
is a white circle ("○"),
"active"
is a green dot ("●"),
"deactivating"
is a white dot,
"failed"
or
"error"
is a red cross ("\(mu"), and
"reloading"
is a green clockwise circle arrow ("↻")\&.
.sp
The "Loaded:" line in the output will show
"loaded"
if the unit has been loaded into memory\&. Other possible values for "Loaded:" include:
"error"
if there was a problem loading it,
"not\-found"
if no unit file was found for this unit,
"bad\-setting"
if an essential unit file setting could not be parsed and
"masked"
if the unit file has been masked\&. Along with showing the path to the unit file, this line will also show the enablement state\&. Enabled units are included in the dependency network between units, and thus are started at boot or via some other form of activation\&. See the full table of possible enablement states \(em including the definition of
"masked"
\(em in the documentation for the
\fBis\-enabled\fR
command\&.
.sp
The "Active:" line shows active state\&. The value is usually
"active"
or
"inactive"\&. Active could mean started, bound, plugged in, etc depending on the unit type\&. The unit could also be in process of changing states, reporting a state of
"activating"
or
"deactivating"\&. A special
"failed"
state is entered when the service failed in some way, such as a crash, exiting with an error code or timing out\&. If the failed state is entered the cause will be logged for later reference\&.

\fBshow\fR [\fIPATTERN\fR\&...|\fIJOB\fR\&...]
.RS 4
Show properties of one or more units, jobs, or the manager itself\&. If no argument is specified, properties of the manager will be shown\&. If a unit name is specified, properties of the unit are shown, and if a job ID is specified, properties of the job are shown\&. By default, empty properties are suppressed\&. Use
\fB\-\-all\fR
to show those too\&. To select specific properties to show, use
\fB\-\-property=\fR\&. This command is intended to be used whenever computer\-parsable output is required\&. Use
\fBstatus\fR
if you are looking for formatted human\-readable output\&.
.sp
Many properties shown by
\fBsystemctl show\fR
map directly to configuration settings of the system and service manager and its unit files\&. Note that the properties shown by the command are generally more low\-level, normalized versions of the original configuration settings and expose runtime state in addition to configuration\&. For example, properties shown for service units include the service\*(Aqs current main process identifier as
"MainPID"
(which is runtime state), and time settings are always exposed as properties ending in the
"\&...USec"
suffix even if a matching configuration options end in
"\&...Sec", because microseconds is the normalized time unit used internally by the system and service manager\&.

.sp
The units that are shown are additionally filtered by
\fB\-\-type=\fR

Start (activate) one or more units specified on the command line\&.
.sp
Note that unit glob patterns expand to names of units currently in memory\&. Units which are not active and are not in a failed state usually are not in memory, and will not be matched by any pattern\&. In addition, in case of instantiated units, systemd is often unaware of the instance name until the instance has been started\&. Therefore, using glob patterns with
\fBstart\fR
has limited usefulness\&. Also, secondary alias names of units are not considered\&.
.sp
Option
\fB\-\-all\fR
may be used to also operate on inactive units which are referenced by other loaded units\&. Note that this is not the same as operating on "all" possible units, because as the previous paragraph describes, such a list is ill\-defined\&. Nevertheless,

fail if any of the commands configured to stop the unit (\fIExecStop=\fR, etc\&.) fail, because the manager will still forcibly terminate the unit\&.

Enable one or more units or unit instances\&. This will create a set of symlinks, as encoded in the [Install] sections of the indicated unit files\&. After the symlinks have been created, the system manager configuration is reloaded (in a way equivalent to
\fBdaemon\-reload\fR), in order to ensure the changes are taken into account immediately\&. Note that this does
\fInot\fR
have the effect of also starting any of the units being enabled\&. If this is desired, combine this command with the
\fB\-\-now\fR
switch, or invoke
\fBstart\fR

foo@bar\&.service), symlinks named the same as instances are created in the unit configuration directory, however they point to the single template unit file they are instantiated from\&.
.sp
This command expects either valid unit names (in which case various unit file directories are automatically searched for unit files with appropriate names), or absolute paths to unit files (in which case these files are read directly)\&. If a specified unit file is located outside of the usual unit file directories, an additional symlink is created, linking it into the unit configuration path, thus ensuring it is found when requested by commands such as
\fBstart\fR\&. The file system where the linked unit files are located must be accessible when systemd is started (e\&.g\&. anything underneath
/home/

is not allowed, unless those directories are located on the root file system)\&.

Note that this operation creates only the symlinks suggested in the [Install] section of the unit files\&. While this command is the recommended way to manipulate the unit configuration directory, the administrator is free to make additional changes manually by placing or removing symlinks below this directory\&. This is particularly useful to create configurations that deviate from the suggested default installation\&. In this case, the administrator must make sure to invoke
\fBdaemon\-reload\fR
manually as necessary, in order to ensure the changes are taken into account\&.

When using this operation on units without install information, a warning about it is shown\&.
\fB\-\-no\-warn\fR

Enabling units should not be confused with starting (activating) units, as done by the

Enabling simply hooks the unit into various suggested places (for example, so that the unit is automatically started on boot or when a particular kind of hardware is plugged in)\&.

\fI$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean argument\&. When true, the "secure" mode of the pager is enabled; if false, disabled\&. If
\fI$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE\fR
is not set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective UID is not the same as the owner of the login session, see
\fBgeteuid\fR(2)

\fBsd_pid_get_owner_uid\fR(3)\&. In secure mode,
\fBLESSSECURE=1\fR
will be set when invoking the pager, and the pager shall disable commands that open or create new files or start new subprocesses\&. When
\fI$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE\fR
is not set at all, pagers which are not known to implement secure mode will not be used\&. (Currently only
\fBless\fR(1)
implements secure mode\&.)
.sp
Note: when commands are invoked with elevated privileges, for example under
\fBsudo\fR(8)

\fBpkexec\fR(1), care must be taken to ensure that unintended interactive features are not enabled\&. "Secure" mode for the pager may be enabled automatically as describe above\&. Setting
\fISYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE=0\fR
or not removing it from the inherited environment allows the user to invoke arbitrary commands\&. Note that if the
\fI$SYSTEMD_PAGER\fR
or
\fI$PAGER\fR

\fI$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE\fR
