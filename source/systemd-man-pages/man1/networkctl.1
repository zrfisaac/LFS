.RE
.PP
\fBreconfigure\fR \fIDEVICE\&...\fR
.RS 4
Reconfigure network interfaces\&. Takes interface name or index number\&. Note that this does not reload
\&.netdev
or
\&.network
corresponding to the specified interface\&. So, if you edit config files, it is necessary to call
\fBnetworkctl reload\fR
first to apply new settings\&.
.sp
Added in version 244\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBreload\fR
.RS 4
Reload
\&.netdev
and
\&.network
files\&. If a new
\&.netdev
file is found, then the corresponding netdev is created\&. Note that even if an existing
\&.netdev
is modified or removed,
\fBsystemd\-networkd\fR
does not update or remove the netdev\&. If a new, modified or removed
\&.network
file is found, then all interfaces which match the file are reconfigured\&.
.sp
Added in version 244\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBedit\fR \fIFILE\fR|\fI@DEVICE\fR\&...
.RS 4
Edit network configuration files, which include
\&.network,
\&.netdev, and
\&.link
files\&. If no network config file matching the given name is found, a new one will be created under
/etc/
or
/run/, depending on whether
\fB\-\-runtime\fR
is specified\&. Specially, if the name is prefixed by
"@", it will be treated as a network interface, and editing will be performed on the network config files associated with it\&. Additionally, the interface name can be suffixed with
":network"
(default) or
":link", in order to choose the type of network config to operate on\&.
.sp
If
\fB\-\-drop\-in=\fR
is specified, edit the drop\-in file instead of the main configuration file\&. Unless
\fB\-\-no\-reload\fR
is specified,
\fBsystemd\-networkd\fR
will be reloaded after the edit of the
\&.network
or
\&.netdev
files finishes\&. The same applies for
\&.link
files and
\fBsystemd-udevd\fR(8)\&. Note that the changed link settings are not automatically applied after reloading\&. To achieve that, trigger uevents for the corresponding interface\&. Refer to
\fBsystemd.link\fR(5)
for more information\&.
.sp
Added in version 254\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBcat\fR [\fIFILE\fR|\fI@DEVICE\fR\&...]
.RS 4
Show network configuration files\&. This command honors the
"@"
prefix in the same way as
\fBedit\fR\&. When no argument is specified,
\fBnetworkd.conf\fR(5)
and its drop\-in files will be shown\&.
.sp
Added in version 254\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBmask\fR \fIFILE\fR\&...
.RS 4
Mask network configuration files, which include
\&.network,
\&.netdev, and
\&.link
files\&. A symlink of the given name will be created under
/etc/
or
/run/, depending on whether
\fB\-\-runtime\fR
is specified, that points to
/dev/null\&. If a non\-empty config file with the specified name exists under the target directory or a directory with higher priority (e\&.g\&.
\fB\-\-runtime\fR
is used while an existing config resides in
/etc/), the operation is aborted\&.
.sp
This command honors
\fB\-\-no\-reload\fR
in the same way as
\fBedit\fR\&.
.sp
Added in version 256\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBunmask\fR \fIFILE\fR\&...
.RS 4
Unmask network configuration files, i\&.e\&. reverting the effect of
\fBmask\fR\&. Note that this command operates regardless of the scope of the directory, i\&.e\&.
\fB\-\-runtime\fR
is of no effect\&.
.sp
This command honors
\fB\-\-no\-reload\fR
in the same way as
\fBedit\fR
and
\fBmask\fR\&.
.sp
Added in version 256\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBpersistent\-storage\fR \fIBOOL\fR
.RS 4
Notify
systemd\-networkd\&.service
that the persistent storage for the service is ready\&. This is called by
systemd\-networkd\-persistent\-storage\&.service\&. Usually, this command should not be called manually by users or administrators\&.
