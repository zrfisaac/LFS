.SH "NAME"

.SH "SYNOPSIS"

\fBresolvectl\fR [OPTIONS...] {COMMAND} [NAME...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBresolvectl\fR
may be used to resolve domain names, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, DNS resource records and services with the
\fBsystemd-resolved.service\fR(8)
resolver service\&. By default, the specified list of parameters will be resolved as hostnames, retrieving their IPv4 and IPv6 addresses\&. If the parameters specified are formatted as IPv4 or IPv6 addresses the reverse operation is done, and a hostname is retrieved for the specified addresses\&.
.PP
The program\*(Aqs output contains information about the protocol used for the look\-up and on which network interface the data was discovered\&. It also contains information on whether the information could be authenticated\&. All data for which local DNSSEC validation succeeds is considered authenticated\&. Moreover all data originating from local, trusted sources is also reported authenticated, including resolution of the local host name, the
"localhost"
hostname or all data from
/etc/hosts\&.
.SH "COMMANDS"

\fBquery\fR \fIHOSTNAME|ADDRESS\fR\&...
.RS 4
Resolve domain names, as well as IPv4 and IPv6 addresses\&. When used in conjunction with
\fB\-\-type=\fR
or
\fB\-\-class=\fR
(see below), resolves low\-level DNS resource records\&.
.sp
If a single\-label domain name is specified it is searched for according to the configured search domains \(em unless
\fB\-\-search=no\fR
or
\fB\-\-type=\fR/\fB\-\-class=\fR
are specified, both of which turn this logic off\&.
.sp
If an international domain name is specified, it is automatically translated according to IDNA rules when resolved via classic DNS \(em but not for look\-ups via MulticastDNS or LLMNR\&. If
\fB\-\-type=\fR/\fB\-\-class=\fR
is used IDNA translation is turned off and domain names are processed as specified\&.
.sp
If combined with
\fB\-\-json=\fR
(only supported in combination with
\fB\-\-type=\fR) will output the resource record data in a JSON object\&.

Get/set per\-interface DNS configuration\&. These commands may be used to configure various DNS settings for network interfaces\&. These commands may be used to inform
\fBsystemd\-resolved\fR
or
\fBsystemd\-networkd\fR
about per\-interface DNS configuration determined through external means\&. The
\fBdns\fR
command expects IPv4 or IPv6 address specifications of DNS servers to use\&. Each address can optionally take a port number separated with
":", a network interface name or index separated with
"%", and a Server Name Indication (SNI) separated with
"#"\&. When IPv6 address is specified with a port number, then the address must be in the square brackets\&. That is, the acceptable full formats are
"111\&.222\&.333\&.444:9953%ifname#example\&.com"
for IPv4 and
"[1111:2222::3333]:9953%ifname#example\&.com"
for IPv6\&. The
\fBdomain\fR
command expects valid DNS domains, possibly prefixed with
"~", and configures a per\-interface search or route\-only domain\&. The
\fBdefault\-route\fR
command expects a boolean parameter, and configures whether the link may be used as default route for DNS lookups, i\&.e\&. if it is suitable for lookups on domains no other link explicitly is configured for\&. The
\fBllmnr\fR,
\fBmdns\fR,
