.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Generators are small executables placed in
/usr/lib/systemd/system\-generators/
and other directories listed above\&.
\fBsystemd\fR(1)
will execute these binaries very early at bootup and at configuration reload time \(em before unit files are loaded\&. Their main purpose is to convert configuration and execution context parameters that are not native to the service manager into dynamically generated unit files, symlinks or unit file drop\-ins, so that they can extend the unit file hierarchy the service manager subsequently loads and operates on\&.
.PP
\fBsystemd\fR
will call each generator with three directory paths that are to be used for generator output\&. In these three directories, generators may dynamically generate unit files (regular ones, instances, as well as templates), unit file
\&.d/
drop\-ins, and create symbolic links to unit files to add additional dependencies, create aliases, or instantiate existing templates\&. Those directories are included in the unit load path, allowing generated configuration to extend or override existing definitions\&. For tests, generators may be called with just one argument; the generator should assume that all three paths are the same in that case\&.
.PP
Directory paths for generator output differ by priority:
\&.../generator\&.early
has priority higher than the admin configuration in
/etc/, while
\&.../generator
has lower priority than
/etc/
but higher than vendor configuration in
/usr/, and
\&.../generator\&.late
has priority lower than all other configuration\&. See the next section and the discussion of unit load paths and unit overriding in
\fBsystemd.unit\fR(5)\&.
.PP
Generators are loaded from a set of paths determined during compilation, as listed above\&. System and user generators are loaded from directories with names ending in
system\-generators/
and
user\-generators/, respectively\&. Generators found in directories listed earlier override the ones with the same name in directories lower in the list
\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2\&. A symlink to
/dev/null
or an empty file can be used to mask a generator, thereby preventing it from running\&. Please note that the order of the two directories with the highest priority is reversed with respect to the unit load path, and generators in
/run/
overwrite those in
/etc/\&.
.PP
After installing new generators or updating the configuration,
\fBsystemctl daemon\-reload\fR
may be executed\&. This will delete the previous configuration created by generators, re\-run all generators, and cause
\fBsystemd\fR
to reload units from disk\&. See
\fBsystemctl\fR(1)
for more information\&.
.SH "OUTPUT DIRECTORIES"
.PP
Generators are invoked with three arguments: paths to directories where generators can place their generated unit files or symlinks\&. By default those paths are runtime directories that are included in the search path of
\fBsystemd\fR, but a generator may be called with different paths for debugging purposes\&. If only one argument is provided, the generator should use the same directory as the three output paths\&.

Note: generators

write to other locations or otherwise make changes to system state\&. Generator output is supposed to last only until the next
\fBdaemon\-reload\fR
or

.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.PP
The service manager sets a number of environment variables when invoking generator executables\&. They carry information about the execution context of the generator, in order to simplify conditionalizing generators to specific environments\&. The following environment variables are set:
.PP
\fI$SYSTEMD_SCOPE\fR
.RS 4
If the generator is invoked from the system service manager this variable is set to
"system"; if invoked from the per\-user service manager it is set to
"user"\&.

.RE
.PP
\fI$SYSTEMD_IN_INITRD\fR
.RS 4
If the generator is run as part of an initrd this is set to
"1"\&. If it is run from the regular host (i\&.e\&. after the transition from initrd to host) it is set to
"0"\&. This environment variable is only set for system generators\&.
.sp
Added in version 251\&.
.RE
.PP
\fI$SYSTEMD_FIRST_BOOT\fR
.RS 4
If this boot\-up cycle is considered a "first boot", this is set to
"1"; if it is a subsequent, regular boot it is set to
"0"\&. For details see the documentation of
\fIConditionFirstBoot=\fR
in
\fBsystemd.unit\fR(5)\&. This environment variable is only set for system generators\&.

\fI$SYSTEMD_VIRTUALIZATION\fR
.RS 4
If the service manager is run in a virtualized environment,
\fI$SYSTEMD_VIRTUALIZATION\fR
is set to a pair of strings, separated by a colon\&. The first string is either
"vm"
or
"container", categorizing the type of virtualization\&. The second string identifies the implementation of the virtualization technology\&. If no virtualization is detected this variable will not be set\&. This data is identical to what
\fBsystemd-detect-virt\fR(1)
detects and reports, and uses the same vocabulary of virtualization implementation identifiers\&.

Generators are run very early at boot and cannot rely on any external services\&. They may not talk to any other process\&. That includes simple things such as logging to
\fBsyslog\fR(3), or
\fBsystemd\fR
itself (this means: no
\fBsystemctl\fR(1))! Non\-essential file systems like
/var/
and
/home/
are mounted after generators have run\&. Generators can however rely on the most basic kernel functionality to be available, as well as mounted
/sys/,
/proc/,
/dev/,
/usr/
and
/run/
file systems\&.

Units written by generators are removed when the configuration is reloaded\&. That means the lifetime of the generated units is closely bound to the reload cycles of
\fBsystemd\fR
itself\&.

Generators should only be used to generate unit files,
\&.d/*\&.conf
drop\-ins for them and symlinks to them, not any other kind of non\-unit related configuration\&. Due to the lifecycle logic mentioned above, generators are not a good fit to generate dynamic configuration for other services\&. If you need to generate dynamic configuration for other services, do so in normal services you order before the service in question\&.
.sp
Note that using the
\fIStandardInputData=\fR/\fIStandardInputText=\fR
settings of service unit files (see
\fBsystemd.exec\fR(5)), it is possible to make arbitrary input data (including daemon\-specific configuration) part of the unit definitions, which often might be sufficient to embed data or configuration for other programs into unit files in a native fashion\&.

The generator should always include its own name in a comment at the top of the generated file, so that the user can easily figure out which component created or amended a particular unit\&.
.sp
The
\fISourcePath=\fR
directive should be used in generated files to specify the source configuration file they are generated from\&. This makes things more easily understood by the user and also has the benefit that systemd can warn the user about configuration files that changed on disk but have not been read yet by systemd\&. The
\fISourcePath=\fR
value does not have to be a file in a physical filesystem\&. For example, in the common case of the generator looking at the kernel command line,
\fBSourcePath=/proc/cmdline\fR
should be used\&.

Generators may write out dynamic unit files or just hook unit files into other units with the usual
\&.wants/
or
\&.requires/
symlinks\&. Often, it is nicer to simply instantiate a template unit file from
/usr/
with a generator instead of writing out entirely dynamic unit files\&. Of course, this works only if a single parameter is to be used\&.

If you are careful, you can implement generators in shell scripts\&. We do recommend C code however, since generators are executed synchronously and hence delay the entire boot if they are slow\&.

Regarding overriding semantics: there are two rules we try to follow when thinking about the overriding semantics:

.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  1." 4.2

User configuration should override vendor configuration\&. This (mostly) means that stuff from
/etc/
should override stuff from
/usr/\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  2." 4.2
.\}
Native configuration should override non\-native configuration\&. This (mostly) means that stuff you generate should never override native unit files for the same purpose\&.
.RE
.sp
Of these two rules the first rule is probably the more important one and breaks the second one sometimes\&. Hence, when deciding whether to use argv[1], argv[2], or argv[3], your default choice should probably be argv[1]\&.

.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\

.el \{\

Instead of heading off now and writing all kind of generators for legacy configuration file formats, please think twice! It is often a better idea to just deprecate old stuff instead of keeping it artificially alive\&.

\fBsystemd-fstab-generator\fR(8)
converts
/etc/fstab
into native mount units\&. It uses argv[1] as location to place the generated unit files in order to allow the user to override
/etc/fstab
with their own native unit files, but also to ensure that
/etc/fstab
overrides any vendor default from
/usr/\&.
.PP
After editing
/etc/fstab, the user should invoke
\fBsystemctl daemon\-reload\fR\&. This will re\-run all generators and cause

\fBsystemctl start \fR\fB\fI/path/to/mountpoint\fR\fR
