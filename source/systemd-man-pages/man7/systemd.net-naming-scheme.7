.SH "NAME"
systemd.net-naming-scheme \- Network device naming schemes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Network interfaces names and MAC addresses may be generated based on certain stable interface attributes\&. This is possible when there is enough information about the device to generate those attributes and the use of this information is configured\&. This page describes interface naming, i\&.e\&. what possible names may be generated\&. Those names are generated by the
\fBsystemd-udevd.service\fR(8)
builtin
\fBnet_id\fR
and exported as udev properties (\fIID_NET_NAME_ONBOARD=\fR,
\fIID_NET_LABEL_ONBOARD=\fR,
\fIID_NET_NAME_PATH=\fR,
\fIID_NET_NAME_SLOT=\fR)\&.
.PP
Names and MAC addresses are derived from various stable device metadata attributes\&. Newer versions of udev take more of these attributes into account, improving (and thus possibly changing) the names and addresses used for the same devices\&. Different versions of those generation rules are called "naming schemes"\&. The default naming scheme is chosen at compilation time\&. Usually this will be the latest implemented version, but it is also possible to set one of the older versions to preserve compatibility\&. This may be useful for example for distributions, which may introduce new versions of systemd in stable releases without changing the naming scheme\&. The naming scheme may also be overridden using the
\fInet\&.naming_scheme=\fR
kernel command line switch, see
\fBsystemd-udevd.service\fR(8)\&. Available naming schemes are described below\&.
.PP
After the udev properties have been generated, appropriate udev rules may be used to actually rename devices based on those properties\&. See the description of
\fINamePolicy=\fR
and
\fIMACAddressPolicy=\fR
in
\fBsystemd.link\fR(5)\&.
.PP
Note that while the concept of network interface naming schemes is primarily relevant in the context of
systemd\-udevd\&.service, the
\fBsystemd-nspawn\fR(1)
container manager also takes it into account when naming network interfaces, see below\&.

kernel command line switch, see above):

This is the naming scheme that was implemented in systemd 238\&.
.sp
Added in version 243\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBv239\fR
.RS 4
Naming was changed for virtual network interfaces created with SR\-IOV and NPAR and for devices where the PCI network controller device does not have a slot number associated\&.
.sp
SR\-IOV virtual devices are named based on the name of the parent interface, with a suffix of
"v\fIport\fR", where
\fIport\fR
is the virtual device number\&. Previously those virtual devices were named as if completely independent\&.
.sp
The ninth and later NPAR virtual devices are named following the scheme used for the first eight NPAR partitions\&. Previously those devices were not renamed and the kernel default ("eth\fIN\fR") was used\&.
.sp
Names are also generated for PCI devices where the PCI network controller device does not have an associated slot number itself, but one of its parents does\&. Previously those devices were not renamed and the kernel default was used\&.
.sp
Added in version 243\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBv240\fR
.RS 4
The
"ib"
prefix and stable names for infiniband devices are introduced\&. Previously those devices were not renamed\&.
.sp
The ACPI index field (used in
\fIID_NET_NAME_ONBOARD=\fR) is now also used when 0\&.
.sp
A new naming policy
\fINamePolicy=keep\fR
was introduced\&. With this policy, if the network device name was already set by userspace, the device will not be renamed again\&. Previously, this naming policy applied implicitly, and now it must be explicitly requested\&. Effectively, this means that network devices will be renamed according to the configuration, even if they have been renamed already, if
\fBkeep\fR
is not specified as the naming policy in the
\&.link
file\&. See
\fBsystemd.link\fR(5)
for a description of
\fINamePolicy=\fR\&.
.sp
Added in version 243\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBv241\fR
.RS 4
\fBMACAddressPolicy=persistent\fR
was extended to set MAC addresses based on the device name\&. Previously addresses were only based on the
\fIID_NET_NAME_*\fR
attributes, which meant that interface names would never be generated for virtual devices\&. Now a persistent address will be generated for most devices, including in particular bridges\&.
.sp
Note: when userspace does not set a MAC address for a bridge device, the kernel will initially assign a random address, and then change it when the first device is enslaved to the bridge\&. With this naming policy change, bridges get a persistent MAC address based on the bridge name instead of the first enslaved device\&.
.sp
Added in version 243\&.
.RE

\fBv243\fR
.RS 4
Support for renaming netdevsim (simulated networking) devices was added\&. Previously those devices were not renamed\&.

derives the name for the host side of the network interface created with
\fB\-\-network\-veth\fR
from the container name it previously simply truncated the result at 15 characters if longer (since that\*(Aqs the maximum length for network interface names)\&. From now on, for any interface name that would be longer than 15 characters the last 4 characters are set to a 24bit hash value of the full interface name\&. This way network interface name collisions between multiple similarly named containers (who only differ in container name suffix) should be less likely (but still possible, since the 24bit hash value is very small)\&.

.RE
.PP
\fBv247\fR
.RS 4
When a PCI slot is associated with a PCI bridge that has multiple child network controllers, the same value of the
\fIID_NET_NAME_SLOT\fR
property might be derived for those controllers\&. This would cause a naming conflict if the property is selected as the device name\&. Now, we detect this situation and don\*(Aqt produce the
\fIID_NET_NAME_SLOT\fR
property\&.
.sp
Added in version 247\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBv249\fR
.RS 4
PCI hotplug slot names for the s390 PCI driver are a hexadecimal representation of the
function_id
device attribute\&. This attribute is now used to build the
\fIID_NET_NAME_SLOT\fR\&. Before that, all slot names were parsed as decimal numbers, which could either result in an incorrect value of the
\fIID_NET_NAME_SLOT\fR
property or none at all\&.
.sp
Some firmware and hypervisor implementations report unreasonably high numbers for the on\-board index\&. To prevent the generation of bogus on\-board interface names, index numbers greater than 16381 (2\(S1⁴\-1) were ignored\&. For s390 PCI devices index values up to 65535 (2\(S1⁶\-1) are valid\&. To account for that, the limit was increased to 65535\&.
.sp
The udev rule
\fINAME=\fR
replaces
":",
"/", and
"%"

.RS 4
Since version
\fBv247\fR
we no longer set
\fIID_NET_NAME_SLOT\fR
if we detect that a PCI device associated with a slot is a PCI bridge as that would create naming conflict when there are more child devices on that bridge\&. Now, this is relaxed and we will use slot information to generate the name based on it but only if the PCI device has multiple functions\&.

.SH "LIMITING THE USE OF SPECIFIC SYSFS ATTRIBUTES"

When creating names for network cards, some naming schemes use data from sysfs populated by the kernel\&. This means that although a specific naming scheme in udev is picked, the network card\*(Aqs name can still change when a new kernel version adds a new sysfs attribute\&. For example if kernel starts setting the
\fBphys_port_name\fR, udev will append the "\fBn\fR\fIphys_port_name\fR" suffix to the device name\&.
