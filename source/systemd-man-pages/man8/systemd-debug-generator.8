.SH "NAME"
systemd-debug-generator \- Generator for enabling a runtime debug shell and masking specific units at boot
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
/usr/lib/systemd/system\-generators/systemd\-debug\-generator
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
systemd\-debug\-generator
is a generator that reads the kernel command line and understands three options:
.PP
If the
\fBsystemd\&.mask=\fR
or
\fBrd\&.systemd\&.mask=\fR
option is specified and followed by a unit name, this unit is masked for the runtime (i\&.e\&. for this session \(em from boot to shutdown), similarly to the effect of
\fBsystemctl\fR(1)\*(Aqs
\fBmask\fR
command\&. This is useful to boot with certain units removed from the initial boot transaction for debugging system startup\&. May be specified more than once\&.
\fBrd\&.systemd\&.mask=\fR
is honored only by initial RAM disk (initrd) while
\fBsystemd\&.mask=\fR
is honored only in the main system\&.
.PP
If the
\fBsystemd\&.wants=\fR
or
\fBrd\&.systemd\&.wants=\fR
option is specified and followed by a unit name, a start job for this unit is added to the initial transaction\&. This is useful to start one or more additional units at boot\&. May be specified more than once\&.
\fBrd\&.systemd\&.wants=\fR
is honored only by initial RAM disk (initrd) while
\fBsystemd\&.wants=\fR
is honored only in the main system\&.
.PP
If the
\fBsystemd\&.debug_shell\fR
or
\fBrd\&.systemd\&.debug_shell\fR
option is specified, the debug shell service
"debug\-shell\&.service"
is pulled into the boot transaction and a debug shell will be spawned during early boot\&. By default,
/dev/tty9
is used, but a specific tty can also be specified, either with or without the
/dev/
prefix\&. To set the tty to use without enabling the debug shell, the
\fBsystemd\&.default_debug_tty=\fR
option can be used which also takes a tty with or without the
/dev/
prefix\&. Note that the shell may also be turned on persistently by enabling it with
\fBsystemctl\fR(1)\*(Aqs
\fBenable\fR
command\&.
\fBrd\&.systemd\&.debug_shell\fR
is honored only by initial RAM disk (initrd) while
\fBsystemd\&.debug_shell\fR
is honored only in the main system\&.
.PP
systemd\-debug\-generator
implements
\fBsystemd.generator\fR(7)\&.
.SH "SYSTEM CREDENTIALS"
.PP
\fIsystemd\&.extra\-unit\&.*\fR
.RS 4
Credentials prefixed with
"systemd\&.extra\-unit\&."
specify additional units to add to the final system\&. Note that these additional units are added to both the initrd and the final system\&.
\fIConditionPathExists=!/etc/initrd\-release\fR
can be used to make sure the unit is conditioned out in the initrd\&. Note that this can also be used to mask units, by simply specifying an empty value\&.
.sp
Added in version 256\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIsystemd\&.unit\-dropin\&.*\fR
.RS 4
Credentials prefixed with
"systemd\&.unit\-dropin\&."
add drop\-ins for the corresponding units in the final system\&. Each credential must be suffixed with the full unit name including the unit extension\&. Its contents must be a valid unit drop\-in file\&. Optionally, the unit name may be followed with
"~", followed by the drop\-in name without the
"\&.conf"
suffix\&. If not specified, the name of the generated drop\-in will be
"50\-credential\&.conf"\&. Note that these additional drop\-ins are added to both the initrd and the final system\&.
.sp
Added in version 256\&.
