.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
These configuration files control global network parameters\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE"
.PP
The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from those defaults\&. The main configuration file is loaded from one of the listed directories in order of priority, only the first file found is used:
/etc/systemd/,
/run/systemd/,
/usr/local/lib/systemd/
\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2,
/usr/lib/systemd/\&. The vendor version of the file contains commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide to the administrator\&. Local overrides can also be created by creating drop\-ins, as described below\&. The main configuration file can also be edited for this purpose (or a copy in
/etc/
if it\*(Aqs shipped under
/usr/), however using drop\-ins for local configuration is recommended over modifications to the main configuration file\&.
.PP
In addition to the main configuration file, drop\-in configuration snippets are read from
/usr/lib/systemd/*\&.conf\&.d/,
/usr/local/lib/systemd/*\&.conf\&.d/, and
/etc/systemd/*\&.conf\&.d/\&. Those drop\-ins have higher precedence and override the main configuration file\&. Files in the
*\&.conf\&.d/
configuration subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the subdirectories they reside\&. When multiple files specify the same option, for options which accept just a single value, the entry in the file sorted last takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of values, entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files\&.
.PP
When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install drop\-ins under
/usr/\&. Files in
/etc/
are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files installed by vendor packages\&. Drop\-ins have to be used to override package drop\-ins, since the main configuration file has lower precedence\&. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a two\-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering\&. This also defines a concept of drop\-in priorities to allow OS vendors to ship drop\-ins within a specific range lower than the range used by users\&. This should lower the risk of package drop\-ins overriding accidentally drop\-ins defined by users\&. It is recommended to use the range 10\-40 for drop\-ins in
/usr/
and the range 60\-90 for drop\-ins in
/etc/
and
/run/, to make sure that local and transient drop\-ins take priority over drop\-ins shipped by the OS vendor\&.
.PP
To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to
/dev/null
in the configuration directory in
/etc/, with the same filename as the vendor configuration file\&.

\fIUseDomains=\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the network\-independent default value for the same setting in the [IPv6AcceptRA] section in

.RE
.SH "[DHCPV4] SECTION OPTIONS"
.PP
This section configures the DHCP Unique Identifier (DUID) value used by DHCP protocol\&. DHCPv4 client protocol sends IAID and DUID to the DHCP server when acquiring a dynamic IPv4 address if
\fBClientIdentifier=duid\fR\&. IAID and DUID allows a DHCP server to uniquely identify the machine and the interface requesting a DHCP IP address\&. To configure IAID and ClientIdentifier, see

\m[blue]\fBRFC 3315\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2
for a description of all the options\&.
.sp
This takes an integer in the range 0\&...65535, or one of the following string values:
.PP
\fBvendor\fR
.RS 4
If
"DUIDType=vendor", then the DUID value will be generated using

Added in version 230\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBuuid\fR
.RS 4
If
"DUIDType=uuid", and
\fIDUIDRawData=\fR
is not set, then the product UUID is used as a DUID value\&. If a system does not have valid product UUID, then an application\-specific
\fBmachine-id\fR(5)
is used as a DUID value\&. About the application\-specific machine ID, see
\fBsd_id128_get_machine_app_specific\fR(3)\&.
.sp
Added in version 230\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBlink\-layer\-time[:\fR\fB\fITIME\fR\fR\fB]\fR, \fBlink\-layer\fR
.RS 4
If
"link\-layer\-time"
or
"link\-layer"
is specified, then the MAC address of the interface is used as a DUID value\&. The value
"link\-layer\-time"
can take additional time value after a colon, e\&.g\&.
"link\-layer\-time:2018\-01\-23 12:34:56 UTC"\&. The default time value is

.RE
.PP
\fIDUIDRawData=\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the DHCP DUID value as a single newline\-terminated, hexadecimal string, with each byte separated by
":"\&. The DUID that is sent is composed of the DUID type specified by
\fIDUIDType=\fR

.sp
The DUID value specified here overrides the DUID that
\fBsystemd-networkd.service\fR(8)
generates from the machine ID\&. To configure DUID per\-network, see
\fBsystemd.network\fR(5)\&. The configured DHCP DUID should conform to the specification in
\m[blue]\fBRFC 3315\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[4]\d\s+2,
