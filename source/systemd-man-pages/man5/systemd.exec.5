\fImount\fR\&.mount,
\fIswap\fR\&.swap
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Unit configuration files for services, sockets, mount points, and swap devices share a subset of configuration options which define the execution environment of spawned processes\&.
.PP
This man page lists the configuration options shared by these four unit types\&. See
\fBsystemd.unit\fR(5)
for the common options of all unit configuration files, and
\fBsystemd.service\fR(5),
\fBsystemd.socket\fR(5),
\fBsystemd.swap\fR(5), and
\fBsystemd.mount\fR(5)
for more information on the specific unit configuration files\&. The execution specific configuration options are configured in the [Service], [Socket], [Mount], or [Swap] sections, depending on the unit type\&.
.PP
In addition, options which control resources through Linux Control Groups (cgroups) are listed in
\fBsystemd.resource-control\fR(5)\&. Those options complement options listed here\&.
.SH "IMPLICIT DEPENDENCIES"

\fIWorkingDirectory=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a directory path relative to the service\*(Aqs root directory specified by
\fIRootDirectory=\fR, or the special value
"~"\&. Sets the working directory for executed processes\&. If set to
"~", the home directory of the user specified in
\fIUser=\fR

\fIRootDirectory=\fR/\fIRootImage=\fR

\fIWorkingDirectory=\fR
is relative to the root of the system running the service manager\&. Note that setting this parameter might result in additional dependencies to be added to the unit (see above)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIRootDirectory=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a directory path relative to the host\*(Aqs root directory (i\&.e\&. the root of the system running the service manager)\&. Sets the root directory for executed processes, with the
\fBpivot_root\fR(2)
or
\fBchroot\fR(2)

.RE
.PP
\fIRootImage=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a path to a block device node or regular file as argument\&. This call is similar to
\fIRootDirectory=\fR
however mounts a file system hierarchy from a block device node or loopback file instead of a directory\&. The device node or file system image file needs to contain a file system without a partition table, or a file system within an MBR/MS\-DOS or GPT partition table with only a single Linux\-compatible partition, or a set of file systems within a GPT partition table that follows the
\m[blue]\fBDiscoverable Partitions Specification\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2\&.
.sp
When
\fIDevicePolicy=\fR
is set to

\fIRootImageOptions=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a comma\-separated list of mount options that will be used on disk images specified by
\fIRootImage=\fR\&. Optionally a partition name can be prefixed, followed by colon, in case the image has multiple partitions, otherwise partition name
"root"
is implied\&. Options for multiple partitions can be specified in a single line with space separators\&. Assigning an empty string removes previous assignments\&. Duplicated options are ignored\&. For a list of valid mount options, please refer to

\fIRootEphemeral=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean argument\&. If enabled, executed processes will run in an ephemeral copy of the root directory or root image\&. The ephemeral copy is placed in
/var/lib/systemd/ephemeral\-trees/
while the service is active and is cleaned up when the service is stopped or restarted\&. If
\fIRootDirectory=\fR
is used and the root directory is a subvolume, the ephemeral copy will be created by making a snapshot of the subvolume\&.
.sp
To make sure making ephemeral copies can be made efficiently, the root directory or root image should be located on the same filesystem as
/var/lib/systemd/ephemeral\-trees/\&. When using
\fIRootEphemeral=\fR
with root directories,
\fBbtrfs\fR(5)
should be used as the filesystem and the root directory should ideally be a subvolume which
\fBsystemd\fR
can snapshot to make the ephemeral copy\&. For root images, a filesystem with support for reflinks should be used to ensure an efficient ephemeral copy\&.

.RE
.PP
\fIRootHash=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a data integrity (dm\-verity) root hash specified in hexadecimal, or the path to a file containing a root hash in ASCII hexadecimal format\&. This option enables data integrity checks using dm\-verity, if the used image contains the appropriate integrity data (see above) or if
\fIRootVerity=\fR
is used\&. The specified hash must match the root hash of integrity data, and is usually at least 256 bits (and hence 64 formatted hexadecimal characters) long (in case of SHA256 for example)\&. If this option is not specified, but the image file carries the
"user\&.verity\&.roothash"
extended file attribute (see
\fBxattr\fR(7)), then the root hash is read from it, also as formatted hexadecimal characters\&. If the extended file attribute is not found (or is not supported by the underlying file system), but a file with the
\&.roothash
suffix is found next to the image file, bearing otherwise the same name (except if the image has the
\&.raw
suffix, in which case the root hash file must not have it in its name), the root hash is read from it and automatically used, also as formatted hexadecimal characters\&.
.sp
If the disk image contains a separate
/usr/
partition it may also be Verity protected, in which case the root hash may configured via an extended attribute
"user\&.verity\&.usrhash"
or a
\&.usrhash
file adjacent to the disk image\&. There\*(Aqs currently no option to configure the root hash for the
/usr/
file system via the unit file directly\&.

\fIRootHashSignature=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a PKCS7 signature of the
\fIRootHash=\fR
option as a path to a DER\-encoded signature file, or as an ASCII base64 string encoding of a DER\-encoded signature prefixed by
"base64:"\&. The dm\-verity volume will only be opened if the signature of the root hash is valid and signed by a public key present in the kernel keyring\&. If this option is not specified, but a file with the
\&.roothash\&.p7s
suffix is found next to the image file, bearing otherwise the same name (except if the image has the
\&.raw
suffix, in which case the signature file must not have it in its name), the signature is read from it and automatically used\&.

\fIRootVerity=\fR
.RS 4
Takes the path to a data integrity (dm\-verity) file\&. This option enables data integrity checks using dm\-verity, if
\fIRootImage=\fR
is used and a root\-hash is passed and if the used image itself does not contain the integrity data\&. The integrity data must be matched by the root hash\&. If this option is not specified, but a file with the
\&.verity
suffix is found next to the image file, bearing otherwise the same name (except if the image has the
\&.raw
suffix, in which case the verity data file must not have it in its name), the verity data is read from it and automatically used\&.
.sp
This option is supported only for disk images that contain a single file system, without an enveloping partition table\&. Images that contain a GPT partition table should instead include both root file system and matching Verity data in the same image, implementing the

Takes a boolean argument\&. If on, a private mount namespace for the unit\*(Aqs processes is created and the API file systems
/proc/,
/sys/,
/dev/
and
/run/
(as an empty
"tmpfs") are mounted inside of it, unless they are already mounted\&. Note that this option has no effect unless used in conjunction with
\fIRootDirectory=\fR/\fIRootImage=\fR
as these four mounts are generally mounted in the host anyway, and unless the root directory is changed, the private mount namespace will be a 1:1 copy of the host\*(Aqs, and include these four mounts\&. Note that the
/dev/
file system of the host is bind mounted if this option is used without
\fIPrivateDevices=\fR\&. To run the service with a private, minimal version of
/dev/, combine this option with
\fIPrivateDevices=\fR\&.
.sp
In order to allow propagating mounts at runtime in a safe manner,
/run/systemd/propagate/
on the host will be used to set up new mounts, and
/run/host/incoming/
in the private namespace will be used as an intermediate step to store them before being moved to the final mount point\&.

\fIProtectProc=\fR
.RS 4
Takes one of
"noaccess",
"invisible",
"ptraceable"
or
"default"
(which it defaults to)\&. When set, this controls the
"hidepid="
mount option of the
"procfs"
instance for the unit that controls which directories with process metainformation (/proc/\fIPID\fR) are visible and accessible: when set to
"noaccess"
the ability to access most of other users\*(Aq process metadata in
/proc/
is taken away for processes of the service\&. When set to
"invisible"
processes owned by other users are hidden from
/proc/\&. If
"ptraceable"
all processes that cannot be
\fBptrace()\fR\*(Aqed by a process are hidden to it\&. If
"default"
no restrictions on
/proc/
access or visibility are made\&. For further details see
\m[blue]\fBThe /proc Filesystem\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2\&. It is generally recommended to run most system services with this option set to
"invisible"\&. This option is implemented via file system namespacing, and thus cannot be used with services that shall be able to install mount points in the host file system hierarchy\&. Note that the root user is unaffected by this option, so to be effective it has to be used together with
\fIUser=\fR
or
\fIDynamicUser=yes\fR, and also without the
"CAP_SYS_PTRACE"
capability, which also allows a process to bypass this feature\&. It cannot be used for services that need to access metainformation about other users\*(Aq processes\&. This option implies
\fIMountAPIVFS=\fR\&.

\m[blue]\fBThe /proc Filesystem\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2\&. Note that Linux exposes various kernel APIs via

.sp
Much like
\fIProtectProc=\fR
above, this is implemented via file system mount namespacing, and hence the same restrictions apply: it is only available to system services, it disables mount propagation to the host mount table, and it implies

.PP
\fIUser=\fR, \fIGroup=\fR
.RS 4
Set the UNIX user or group that the processes are executed as, respectively\&. Takes a single user or group name, or a numeric ID as argument\&. For system services (services run by the system service manager, i\&.e\&. managed by PID 1) and for user services of the root user (services managed by root\*(Aqs instance of
\fBsystemd \-\-user\fR), the default is
"root", but
\fIUser=\fR
may be used to specify a different user\&. For user services of any other user, switching user identity is not permitted, hence the only valid setting is the same user the user\*(Aqs service manager is running as\&. If no group is set, the default group of the user is used\&. This setting does not affect commands whose command line is prefixed with
"+"\&.
.sp
Note that this enforces only weak restrictions on the user/group name syntax, but will generate warnings in many cases where user/group names do not adhere to the following rules: the specified name should consist only of the characters a\-z, A\-Z, 0\-9,
"_"
and
"\-", except for the first character which must be one of a\-z, A\-Z and
"_"
(i\&.e\&. digits and
"\-"
are not permitted as first character)\&. The user/group name must have at least one character, and at most 31\&. These restrictions are made in order to avoid ambiguities and to ensure user/group names and unit files remain portable among Linux systems\&. For further details on the names accepted and the names warned about see
\m[blue]\fBUser/Group Name Syntax\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2\&.
.sp
When used in conjunction with
\fIDynamicUser=\fR
the user/group name specified is dynamically allocated at the time the service is started, and released at the time the service is stopped \(em unless it is already allocated statically (see below)\&. If
\fIDynamicUser=\fR
is not used the specified user and group must have been created statically in the user database no later than the moment the service is started, for example using the
\fBsysusers.d\fR(5)
facility, which is applied at boot or package install time\&. If the user does not exist by then program invocation will fail\&.
.sp
If the
\fIUser=\fR
setting is used the supplementary group list is initialized from the specified user\*(Aqs default group list, as defined in the system\*(Aqs user and group database\&. Additional groups may be configured through the
\fISupplementaryGroups=\fR
setting (see below)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIDynamicUser=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean parameter\&. If set, a UNIX user and group pair is allocated dynamically when the unit is started, and released as soon as it is stopped\&. The user and group will not be added to
/etc/passwd
or
/etc/group, but are managed transiently during runtime\&. The
\fBnss-systemd\fR(8)
glibc NSS module provides integration of these dynamic users/groups into the system\*(Aqs user and group databases\&. The user and group name to use may be configured via
\fIUser=\fR
and
\fIGroup=\fR
(see above)\&. If these options are not used and dynamic user/group allocation is enabled for a unit, the name of the dynamic user/group is implicitly derived from the unit name\&. If the unit name without the type suffix qualifies as valid user name it is used directly, otherwise a name incorporating a hash of it is used\&. If a statically allocated user or group of the configured name already exists, it is used and no dynamic user/group is allocated\&. Note that if
\fIUser=\fR
is specified and the static group with the name exists, then it is required that the static user with the name already exists\&. Similarly, if
\fIGroup=\fR
is specified and the static user with the name exists, then it is required that the static group with the name already exists\&. Dynamic users/groups are allocated from the UID/GID range 61184\&...65519\&. It is recommended to avoid this range for regular system or login users\&. At any point in time each UID/GID from this range is only assigned to zero or one dynamically allocated users/groups in use\&. However, UID/GIDs are recycled after a unit is terminated\&. Care should be taken that any processes running as part of a unit for which dynamic users/groups are enabled do not leave files or directories owned by these users/groups around, as a different unit might get the same UID/GID assigned later on, and thus gain access to these files or directories\&. If
\fIDynamicUser=\fR
is enabled,
\fIRemoveIPC=\fR
and
\fIPrivateTmp=\fR
are implied (and cannot be turned off)\&. This ensures that the lifetime of IPC objects and temporary files created by the executed processes is bound to the runtime of the service, and hence the lifetime of the dynamic user/group\&. Since
/tmp/
and
/var/tmp/
are usually the only world\-writable directories on a system this ensures that a unit making use of dynamic user/group allocation cannot leave files around after unit termination\&. Furthermore
\fINoNewPrivileges=\fR
and
\fIRestrictSUIDSGID=\fR
are implicitly enabled (and cannot be disabled), to ensure that processes invoked cannot take benefit or create SUID/SGID files or directories\&. Moreover
\fIProtectSystem=strict\fR
and
\fIProtectHome=read\-only\fR
are implied, thus prohibiting the service to write to arbitrary file system locations\&. In order to allow the service to write to certain directories, they have to be allow\-listed using
\fIReadWritePaths=\fR, but care must be taken so that UID/GID recycling doesn\*(Aqt create security issues involving files created by the service\&. Use
\fIRuntimeDirectory=\fR
(see below) in order to assign a writable runtime directory to a service, owned by the dynamic user/group and removed automatically when the unit is terminated\&. Use
\fIStateDirectory=\fR,
\fICacheDirectory=\fR
and
\fILogsDirectory=\fR
in order to assign a set of writable directories for specific purposes to the service in a way that they are protected from vulnerabilities due to UID reuse (see below)\&. If this option is enabled, care should be taken that the unit\*(Aqs processes do not get access to directories outside of these explicitly configured and managed ones\&. Specifically, do not use
\fIBindPaths=\fR
and be careful with
\fBAF_UNIX\fR
file descriptor passing for directory file descriptors, as this would permit processes to create files or directories owned by the dynamic user/group that are not subject to the lifecycle and access guarantees of the service\&. Note that this option is currently incompatible with D\-Bus policies, thus a service using this option may currently not allocate a D\-Bus service name (note that this does not affect calling into other D\-Bus services)\&.

\fIUser=\fR,
\fIDynamicUser=\fR, or

setting, and is otherwise ignored\&. If not set, no PAM session will be opened for the executed processes\&. See
\fBpam\fR(8)

.sp
Note that for each unit making use of this option a PAM session handler process will be maintained as part of the unit and stays around as long as the unit is active, to ensure that appropriate actions can be taken when the unit and hence the PAM session terminates\&. This process is named
"(sd\-pam)"
and is an immediate child process of the unit\*(Aqs main process\&.
.sp
Note that when this option is used for a unit it is very likely (depending on PAM configuration) that the main unit process will be migrated to its own session scope unit when it is activated\&. This process will hence be associated with two units: the unit it was originally started from (and for which
\fIPAMName=\fR
was configured), and the session scope unit\&. Any child processes of that process will however be associated with the session scope unit only\&. This has implications when used in combination with
\fINotifyAccess=\fR\fBall\fR, as these child processes will not be able to affect changes in the original unit through notification messages\&. These messages will be considered belonging to the session scope unit and not the original unit\&. It is hence not recommended to use

Set soft and hard limits on various resources for executed processes\&. See
\fBsetrlimit\fR(2)
for details on the process resource limit concept\&. Process resource limits may be specified in two formats: either as single value to set a specific soft and hard limit to the same value, or as colon\-separated pair
\fBsoft:hard\fR
to set both limits individually (e\&.g\&.
"LimitAS=4G:16G")\&. Use the string
\fBinfinity\fR
to configure no limit on a specific resource\&. The multiplicative suffixes K, M, G, T, P and E (to the base 1024) may be used for resource limits measured in bytes (e\&.g\&.
"LimitAS=16G")\&. For the limits referring to time values, the usual time units ms, s, min, h and so on may be used (see
\fBsystemd.time\fR(7)
for details)\&. Note that if no time unit is specified for
\fILimitCPU=\fR
the default unit of seconds is implied, while for
\fILimitRTTIME=\fR
the default unit of microseconds is implied\&. Also, note that the effective granularity of the limits might influence their enforcement\&. For example, time limits specified for
\fILimitCPU=\fR
will be rounded up implicitly to multiples of 1s\&. For
\fILimitNICE=\fR
the value may be specified in two syntaxes: if prefixed with
"+"
or
"\-", the value is understood as regular Linux nice value in the range \-20\&...19\&. If not prefixed like this the value is understood as raw resource limit parameter in the range 0\&...40 (with 0 being equivalent to 1)\&.
.sp
Note that most process resource limits configured with these options are per\-process, and processes may fork in order to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted independently of the original process, and may thus escape limits set\&. Also note that
\fILimitRSS=\fR
is not implemented on Linux, and setting it has no effect\&. Often it is advisable to prefer the resource controls listed in
\fBsystemd.resource-control\fR(5)
over these per\-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may be altered dynamically at runtime, and are generally more expressive\&. For example,
\fIMemoryMax=\fR
is a more powerful (and working) replacement for
\fILimitRSS=\fR\&.
.sp
Note that
\fILimitNPROC=\fR
will limit the number of processes from one (real) UID and not the number of processes started (forked) by the service\&. Therefore the limit is cumulative for all processes running under the same UID\&. Please also note that the
\fILimitNPROC=\fR
will not be enforced if the service is running as root (and not dropping privileges)\&. Due to these limitations,
\fITasksMax=\fR
(see
\fBsystemd.resource-control\fR(5)) is typically a better choice than
\fILimitNPROC=\fR\&.
.sp
Resource limits not configured explicitly for a unit default to the value configured in the various
\fIDefaultLimitCPU=\fR,
\fIDefaultLimitFSIZE=\fR, \&... options available in
\fBsystemd-system.conf\fR(5), and \(en if not configured there \(en the kernel or per\-user defaults, as defined by the OS (the latter only for user services, see below)\&.
.sp
For system units these resource limits may be chosen freely\&. When these settings are configured in a user service (i\&.e\&. a service run by the per\-user instance of the service manager) they cannot be used to raise the limits above those set for the user manager itself when it was first invoked, as the user\*(Aqs service manager generally lacks the privileges to do so\&. In user context these configuration options are hence only useful to lower the limits passed in or to raise the soft limit to the maximum of the hard limit as configured for the user\&. To raise the user\*(Aqs limits further, the available configuration mechanisms differ between operating systems, but typically require privileges\&. In most cases it is possible to configure higher per\-user resource limits via PAM or by setting limits on the system service encapsulating the user\*(Aqs service manager, i\&.e\&. the user\*(Aqs instance of
user@\&.service\&. After making such changes, make sure to restart the user\*(Aqs service manager\&.

The following sandboxing options are an effective way to limit the exposure of the system towards the unit\*(Aqs processes\&. It is recommended to turn on as many of these options for each unit as is possible without negatively affecting the process\*(Aq ability to operate\&. Note that many of these sandboxing features are gracefully turned off on systems where the underlying security mechanism is not available\&. For example,
\fIProtectSystem=\fR
has no effect if the kernel is built without file system namespacing or if the service manager runs in a container manager that makes file system namespacing unavailable to its payload\&. Similarly,
\fIRestrictRealtime=\fR
has no effect on systems that lack support for SECCOMP system call filtering, or in containers where support for this is turned off\&.
.PP
Also note that some sandboxing functionality is generally not available in user services (i\&.e\&. services run by the per\-user service manager)\&. Specifically, the various settings requiring file system namespacing support (such as
\fIProtectSystem=\fR) are not available, as the underlying kernel functionality is only accessible to privileged processes\&. However, most namespacing settings, that will not work on their own in user services, will work when used in conjunction with
\fIPrivateUsers=\fR\fBtrue\fR\&.

Note that the various options that turn directories read\-only (such as
\fIProtectSystem=\fR,

are made inaccessible and empty for processes invoked by this unit\&. If set to
"read\-only", the three directories are made read\-only instead\&. If set to

"tmpfs"
is useful to hide home directories not relevant to the processes invoked by the unit, while still allowing necessary directories to be made visible when listed in

If the specified directories already exist and their owning user or group do not match the configured ones, all files and directories below the specified directories as well as the directories themselves will have their file ownership recursively changed to match what is configured\&. As an optimization, if the specified directories are already owned by the right user and group, files and directories below of them are left as\-is, even if they do not match what is requested\&. The innermost specified directories will have their access mode adjusted to the what is specified in
\fIRuntimeDirectoryMode=\fR,
\fIStateDirectoryMode=\fR,
\fICacheDirectoryMode=\fR,

.sp
These options imply
\fIBindPaths=\fR
for the specified paths\&. When combined with
\fIRootDirectory=\fR
or
\fIRootImage=\fR
these paths always reside on the host and are mounted from there into the unit\*(Aqs file system namespace\&.
.sp
If
\fIDynamicUser=\fR
is used, the logic for
\fICacheDirectory=\fR,
\fILogsDirectory=\fR
and
\fIStateDirectory=\fR
is slightly altered: the directories are created below
/var/cache/private,
/var/log/private
and
/var/lib/private, respectively, which are host directories made inaccessible to unprivileged users, which ensures that access to these directories cannot be gained through dynamic user ID recycling\&. Symbolic links are created to hide this difference in behaviour\&. Both from perspective of the host and from inside the unit, the relevant directories hence always appear directly below
/var/cache,
/var/log
and
/var/lib\&.
.sp
Use
\fIRuntimeDirectory=\fR
to manage one or more runtime directories for the unit and bind their lifetime to the daemon runtime\&. This is particularly useful for unprivileged daemons that cannot create runtime directories in
/run/
due to lack of privileges, and to make sure the runtime directory is cleaned up automatically after use\&. For runtime directories that require more complex or different configuration or lifetime guarantees, please consider using
\fBtmpfiles.d\fR(5)\&.
.sp
\fIRuntimeDirectory=\fR,
\fIStateDirectory=\fR,
\fICacheDirectory=\fR
and
\fILogsDirectory=\fR
optionally support a second parameter, separated by
":"\&. The second parameter will be interpreted as a destination path that will be created as a symlink to the directory\&. The symlinks will be created after any
\fIBindPaths=\fR
or
\fITemporaryFileSystem=\fR
options have been set up, to make ephemeral symlinking possible\&. The same source can have multiple symlinks, by using the same first parameter, but a different second parameter\&.
.sp
The directories defined by these options are always created under the standard paths used by systemd (/var/,
/run/,
/etc/, \&...)\&. If the service needs directories in a different location, a different mechanism has to be used to create them\&.
.sp
\fBtmpfiles.d\fR(5)
provides functionality that overlaps with these options\&. Using these options is recommended, because the lifetime of the directories is tied directly to the lifetime of the unit, and it is not necessary to ensure that the
tmpfiles\&.d
configuration is executed before the unit is started\&.
.sp
To remove any of the directories created by these settings, use the
\fBsystemctl clean \&...\fR
command on the relevant units, see
\fBsystemctl\fR(1)
for details\&.

will be made inaccessible for processes inside the namespace along with everything below them in the file system hierarchy\&. This may be more restrictive than desired, because it is not possible to nest
\fIReadWritePaths=\fR,

\fIBindReadOnlyPaths=\fR
inside it\&. For a more flexible option, see

Content in paths listed in

are not executable even if the usual file access controls would permit this\&. Nest
\fIExecPaths=\fR

.sp
Non\-directory paths may be specified as well\&. These options may be specified more than once, in which case all paths listed will have limited access from within the namespace\&. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the specific list is reset, and all prior assignments have no effect\&.
.sp
Paths in
\fIReadWritePaths=\fR,
\fIReadOnlyPaths=\fR,
\fIInaccessiblePaths=\fR,
\fIExecPaths=\fR
and
\fINoExecPaths=\fR
may be prefixed with
"\-", in which case they will be ignored when they do not exist\&. If prefixed with
"+"
the paths are taken relative to the root directory of the unit, as configured with
\fIRootDirectory=\fR/\fIRootImage=\fR, instead of relative to the root directory of the host (see above)\&. When combining
"\-"
and
"+"
on the same path make sure to specify
"\-"
first, and
"+"
second\&.
.sp
Note that these settings will disconnect propagation of mounts from the unit\*(Aqs processes to the host\&. This means that this setting may not be used for services which shall be able to install mount points in the main mount namespace\&. For
\fIReadWritePaths=\fR
and
\fIReadOnlyPaths=\fR, propagation in the other direction is not affected, i\&.e\&. mounts created on the host generally appear in the unit processes\*(Aq namespace, and mounts removed on the host also disappear there too\&. In particular, note that mount propagation from host to unit will result in unmodified mounts to be created in the unit\*(Aqs namespace, i\&.e\&. writable mounts appearing on the host will be writable in the unit\*(Aqs namespace too, even when propagated below a path marked with
\fIReadOnlyPaths=\fR! Restricting access with these options hence does not extend to submounts of a directory that are created later on\&. This means the lock\-down offered by that setting is not complete, and does not offer full protection\&.
.sp
Note that the effect of these settings may be undone by privileged processes\&. In order to set up an effective sandboxed environment for a unit it is thus recommended to combine these settings with either
\fICapabilityBoundingSet=~CAP_SYS_ADMIN\fR
or
\fISystemCallFilter=~@mount\fR\&.
.sp
Please be extra careful when applying these options to API file systems (a list of them could be found in
\fIMountAPIVPS=\fR), since they may be required for basic system functionalities\&. Moreover,
/run/
needs to be writable for setting up mount namespace and propagation\&.

This option may be specified more than once, in which case temporary file systems are mounted on all listed mount points\&. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the list is reset, and all prior assignments have no effect\&. Each mount point may optionally be suffixed with a colon (":") and mount options such as

user and group as well as the unit\*(Aqs own user and group to themselves and everything else to the
"nobody"
user and group\&. This is useful to securely detach the user and group databases used by the unit from the rest of the system, and thus to create an effective sandbox environment\&. All files, directories, processes, IPC objects and other resources owned by users/groups not equaling
"root"
or the unit\*(Aqs own will stay visible from within the unit but appear owned by the
"nobody"
user and group\&. If this mode is enabled, all unit processes are run without privileges in the host user namespace (regardless if the unit\*(Aqs own user/group is
"root"
or not)\&. Specifically this means that the process will have zero process capabilities on the host\*(Aqs user namespace, but full capabilities within the service\*(Aqs user namespace\&. Settings such as
\fICapabilityBoundingSet=\fR
will affect only the latter, and there\*(Aqs no way to acquire additional capabilities in the host\*(Aqs user namespace\&. Defaults to off\&.

When this setting is set up by a per\-user instance of the service manager, the mapping of the

By prepending the list with a single tilde character ("~") the effect may be inverted: only the listed namespace types will be made inaccessible, all unlisted ones are permitted (deny\-listing)\&. If the empty string is assigned, the default namespace restrictions are applied, which is equivalent to false\&. This option may appear more than once, in which case the namespace types are merged by
\fBOR\fR, or by

Takes a boolean argument\&. If set, attempts to create memory mappings that are writable and executable at the same time, or to change existing memory mappings to become executable, or mapping shared memory segments as executable, are prohibited\&. Specifically, a system call filter is added (or preferably, an equivalent kernel check is enabled with

Note that this option is incompatible with programs and libraries that generate program code dynamically at runtime, including JIT execution engines, executable stacks, and code "trampoline" feature of various C compilers\&. This option improves service security, as it makes harder for software exploits to change running code dynamically\&. However, the protection can be circumvented, if the service can write to a filesystem, which is not mounted with
\fBnoexec\fR

/dev/shm), or it can use
\fBmemfd_create()\fR\&. This can be prevented by making such file systems inaccessible to the service (e\&.g\&.

protection is not available on x86\&. Note that on systems supporting multiple ABIs (such as x86/x86\-64) it is recommended to turn off alternative ABIs for services, so that they cannot be used to circumvent the restrictions of this option\&.

As the SUID/SGID bits are mechanisms to elevate privileges, and allow users to acquire the identity of other users, it is recommended to restrict creation of SUID/SGID files to the few programs that actually require them\&.

\fIPrivateMounts=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean parameter\&. If set, the processes of this unit will be run in their own private file system (mount) namespace with all mount propagation from the processes towards the host\*(Aqs main file system namespace turned off\&. This means any file system mount points established or removed by the unit\*(Aqs processes will be private to them and not be visible to the host\&. However, file system mount points established or removed on the host will be propagated to the unit\*(Aqs processes\&. See
\fBmount_namespaces\fR(7)
for details on file system namespaces\&. Defaults to off\&.
.sp
When turned on, this executes three operations for each invoked process: a new
\fBCLONE_NEWNS\fR
namespace is created, after which all existing mounts are remounted to
\fBMS_SLAVE\fR
to disable propagation from the unit\*(Aqs processes to the host (but leaving propagation in the opposite direction in effect)\&. Finally, the mounts are remounted again to the propagation mode configured with
\fIMountFlags=\fR, see below\&.
.sp
File system namespaces are set up individually for each process forked off by the service manager\&. Mounts established in the namespace of the process created by
\fIExecStartPre=\fR
will hence be cleaned up automatically as soon as that process exits and will not be available to subsequent processes forked off for
\fIExecStart=\fR
(and similar applies to the various other commands configured for units)\&. Similarly,
\fIJoinsNamespaceOf=\fR

for details on mount propagation, and the three propagation flags in particular\&.
.sp
This setting only controls the
\fIfinal\fR
propagation setting in effect on all mount points of the file system namespace created for each process of this unit\&. Other file system namespacing unit settings (see the discussion in
\fIPrivateMounts=\fR
above) will implicitly disable mount and unmount propagation from the unit\*(Aqs processes towards the host by changing the propagation setting of all mount points in the unit\*(Aqs file system namespace to
\fBslave\fR
first\&. Setting this option to
\fBshared\fR
does not reestablish propagation in that case\&.
.sp
If not set \(en but file system namespaces are enabled through another file system namespace unit setting \(en
\fBshared\fR
mount propagation is used, but \(em as mentioned \(em as
\fBslave\fR
is applied first, propagation from the unit\*(Aqs processes to the host is still turned off\&.
.sp
It is not recommended to use
\fBprivate\fR
mount propagation for units, as this means temporary mounts (such as removable media) of the host will stay mounted and thus indefinitely busy in forked off processes, as unmount propagation events won\*(Aqt be received by the file system namespace of the unit\&.

.SH "SYSTEM CALL FILTERING"

\fISystemCallFilter=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a space\-separated list of system call names\&. If this setting is used, all system calls executed by the unit processes except for the listed ones will result in immediate process termination with the
\fBSIGSYS\fR
signal (allow\-listing)\&. (See
\fISystemCallErrorNumber=\fR
below for changing the default action)\&. If the first character of the list is
"~", the effect is inverted: only the listed system calls will result in immediate process termination (deny\-listing)\&. Deny\-listed system calls and system call groups may optionally be suffixed with a colon (":") and
"errno"
error number (between 0 and 4095) or errno name such as
\fBEPERM\fR,
\fBEACCES\fR
or
\fBEUCLEAN\fR
(see
\fBerrno\fR(3)
for a full list)\&. This value will be returned when a deny\-listed system call is triggered, instead of terminating the processes immediately\&. Special setting
"kill"
can be used to explicitly specify killing\&. This value takes precedence over the one given in
\fISystemCallErrorNumber=\fR, see below\&. This feature makes use of the Secure Computing Mode 2 interfaces of the kernel (\*(Aqseccomp filtering\*(Aq) and is useful for enforcing a minimal sandboxing environment\&. Note that the
\fBexecve()\fR,
\fBexit()\fR,
\fBexit_group()\fR,
\fBgetrlimit()\fR,
\fBrt_sigreturn()\fR,
\fBsigreturn()\fR
system calls and the system calls for querying time and sleeping are implicitly allow\-listed and do not need to be listed explicitly\&. This option may be specified more than once, in which case the filter masks are merged\&. If the empty string is assigned, the filter is reset, all prior assignments will have no effect\&. This does not affect commands prefixed with
"+"\&.
.sp
Note that on systems supporting multiple ABIs (such as x86/x86\-64) it is recommended to turn off alternative ABIs for services, so that they cannot be used to circumvent the restrictions of this option\&. Specifically, it is recommended to combine this option with
\fISystemCallArchitectures=native\fR
or similar\&.
.sp
Note that strict system call filters may impact execution and error handling code paths of the service invocation\&. Specifically, access to the
\fBexecve()\fR
system call is required for the execution of the service binary \(em if it is blocked service invocation will necessarily fail\&. Also, if execution of the service binary fails for some reason (for example: missing service executable), the error handling logic might require access to an additional set of system calls in order to process and log this failure correctly\&. It might be necessary to temporarily disable system call filters in order to simplify debugging of such failures\&.
.sp
If you specify both types of this option (i\&.e\&. allow\-listing and deny\-listing), the first encountered will take precedence and will dictate the default action (termination or approval of a system call)\&. Then the next occurrences of this option will add or delete the listed system calls from the set of the filtered system calls, depending of its type and the default action\&. (For example, if you have started with an allow list rule for
\fBread()\fR
and
\fBwrite()\fR, and right after it add a deny list rule for
\fBwrite()\fR, then
\fBwrite()\fR
will be removed from the set\&.)

.TE
.sp 1
Note, that as new system calls are added to the kernel, additional system calls might be added to the groups above\&. Contents of the sets may also change between systemd versions\&. In addition, the list of system calls depends on the kernel version and architecture for which systemd was compiled\&. Use
\fBsystemd\-analyze\ \&syscall\-filter\fR
to list the actual list of system calls in each filter\&.
.sp
Generally, allow\-listing system calls (rather than deny\-listing) is the safer mode of operation\&. It is recommended to enforce system call allow lists for all long\-running system services\&. Specifically, the following lines are a relatively safe basic choice for the majority of system services:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[Service]
SystemCallFilter=@system\-service
SystemCallErrorNumber=EPERM
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Note that various kernel system calls are defined redundantly: there are multiple system calls for executing the same operation\&. For example, the
\fBpidfd_send_signal()\fR
system call may be used to execute operations similar to what can be done with the older
\fBkill()\fR
system call, hence blocking the latter without the former only provides weak protection\&. Since new system calls are added regularly to the kernel as development progresses, keeping system call deny lists comprehensive requires constant work\&. It is thus recommended to use allow\-listing instead, which offers the benefit that new system calls are by default implicitly blocked until the allow list is updated\&.
.sp
Also note that a number of system calls are required to be accessible for the dynamic linker to work\&. The dynamic linker is required for running most regular programs (specifically: all dynamic ELF binaries, which is how most distributions build packaged programs)\&. This means that blocking these system calls (which include
\fBopen()\fR,
\fBopenat()\fR
or
\fBmmap()\fR) will make most programs typically shipped with generic distributions unusable\&.
.sp
It is recommended to combine the file system namespacing related options with
\fISystemCallFilter=~@mount\fR, in order to prohibit the unit\*(Aqs processes to undo the mappings\&. Specifically these are the options

\fBx32\fR,
\fBmips64\-n32\fR,
\fBmips64\-le\-n32\fR, and the special identifier
\fBnative\fR\&. The special identifier
\fBnative\fR
implicitly maps to the native architecture of the system (or more precisely: to the architecture the system manager is compiled for)\&. By default, this option is set to the empty list, i\&.e\&. no filtering is applied\&.
.sp
If this setting is used, processes of this unit will only be permitted to call native system calls, and system calls of the specified architectures\&. For the purposes of this option, the x32 architecture is treated as including x86\-64 system calls\&. However, this setting still fulfills its purpose, as explained below, on x32\&.
.sp
System call filtering is not equally effective on all architectures\&. For example, on x86 filtering of network socket\-related calls is not possible, due to ABI limitations \(em a limitation that x86\-64 does not have, however\&. On systems supporting multiple ABIs at the same time \(em such as x86/x86\-64 \(em it is hence recommended to limit the set of permitted system call architectures so that secondary ABIs may not be used to circumvent the restrictions applied to the native ABI of the system\&. In particular, setting
\fISystemCallArchitectures=native\fR
is a good choice for disabling non\-native ABIs\&.

Note that environment variables are not suitable for passing secrets (such as passwords, key material, \&...) to service processes\&. Environment variables set for a unit are exposed to unprivileged clients via D\-Bus IPC, and generally not understood as being data that requires protection\&. Moreover, environment variables are propagated down the process tree, including across security boundaries (such as setuid/setgid executables), and hence might leak to processes that should not have access to the secret data\&.

In the file, an unquoted value after the
"="
is parsed with the same backslash\-escape rules as
\m[blue]\fBPOSIX shell unquoted text\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[11]\d\s+2, but unlike in a shell, interior whitespace is preserved and quotes after the first non\-whitespace character are preserved\&. Leading and trailing whitespace (space, tab, carriage return) is discarded, but interior whitespace within the line is preserved verbatim\&. A line ending with a backslash will be continued to the following one, with the newline itself discarded\&. A backslash
"\e"
followed by any character other than newline will preserve the following character, so that
"\e\e"

"\e"\&.
.sp
In the file, a
"\*(Aq"\-quoted value after the
"="
can span multiple lines and contain any character verbatim other than single quote, like
\m[blue]\fBPOSIX shell single\-quoted text\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[12]\d\s+2\&. No backslash\-escape sequences are recognized\&. Leading and trailing whitespace outside of the single quotes is discarded\&.

"""\-quoted value after the
"="
can span multiple lines, and the same escape sequences are recognized as in

""\e`$"
will preserve that character\&. A backslash followed by newline is a line continuation, and the newline itself is discarded\&. A backslash followed by any other character is ignored; both the backslash and the following character are preserved verbatim\&. Leading and trailing whitespace outside of the double quotes is discarded\&.

The argument passed should be an absolute filename or wildcard expression, optionally prefixed with

The

\fIStandardInputText=\fR/\fIStandardInputData=\fR

.sp
The
\fBfile:\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR

":"

socket in the file system is specified, a stream socket is connected to it\&. The latter is useful for connecting standard input of processes to arbitrary system services\&.

\fBsystemd.socket\fR(5)

\fIAccept=yes\fR
set, or to specify a single socket only\&. If this option is set, standard input will be connected to the socket the service was activated from, which is primarily useful for compatibility with daemons designed for use with the traditional

\fBinherit\fR
duplicates the file descriptor of standard input for standard output\&.

\fBnull\fR
connects standard output to

.sp
\fBtty\fR
connects standard output to a tty (as configured via
\fITTYPath=\fR, see below)\&. If the TTY is used for output only, the executed process will not become the controlling process of the terminal, and will not fail or wait for other processes to release the terminal\&.

\fBjournal\fR
connects standard output with the journal, which is accessible via
\fBjournalctl\fR(1)\&. Note that everything that is written to kmsg (see below) is implicitly stored in the journal as well, the specific option listed below is hence a superset of this one\&.

.sp
\fBkmsg\fR
connects standard output with the kernel log buffer which is accessible via
\fBdmesg\fR(1), in addition to the journal\&. The journal daemon might be configured to send all logs to kmsg anyway, in which case this option is no different from
\fBjournal\fR\&.

\fBjournal+console\fR

\fBkmsg+console\fR
work in a similar way as the two options above but copy the output to the system console as well\&.
.sp
The
\fBfile:\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
option may be used to connect a specific file system object to standard output\&. The semantics are similar to the same option of
\fIStandardInput=\fR, see above\&. If
\fIpath\fR
refers to a regular file on the filesystem, it is opened (created if it doesn\*(Aqt exist yet using privileges of the user executing the systemd process) for writing at the beginning of the file, but without truncating it\&. If standard input and output are directed to the same file path, it is opened only once \(em for reading as well as writing \(em and duplicated\&. This is particularly useful when the specified path refers to an
\fBAF_UNIX\fR
socket in the file system, as in that case only a single stream connection is created for both input and output\&.
.sp
\fBappend:\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
is similar to
\fBfile:\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
above, but it opens the file in append mode\&.
.sp
\fBtruncate:\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
is similar to
\fBfile:\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
above, but it truncates the file when opening it\&. For units with multiple command lines, e\&.g\&.
\fIType=oneshot\fR
services with multiple
\fIExecStart=\fR, or services with
\fIExecCondition=\fR,
\fIExecStartPre=\fR
or
\fIExecStartPost=\fR, the output file is reopened and therefore re\-truncated for each command line\&. If the output file is truncated while another process still has the file open, e\&.g\&. by an
\fIExecReload=\fR
running concurrently with an
\fIExecStart=\fR, and the other process continues writing to the file without adjusting its offset, then the space between the file pointers of the two processes may be filled with
\fBNUL\fR
bytes, producing a sparse file\&. Thus,
\fBtruncate:\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
is typically only useful for units where only one process runs at a time, such as services with a single
\fIExecStart=\fR
and no
\fIExecStartPost=\fR,
\fIExecReload=\fR,
\fIExecStop=\fR
or similar\&.
.sp
\fBsocket\fR
connects standard output to a socket acquired via socket activation\&. The semantics are similar to the same option of
\fIStandardInput=\fR, see above\&.
.sp
The
\fBfd:\fR\fB\fIname\fR\fR
option connects standard output to a specific, named file descriptor provided by a socket unit\&. A name may be specified as part of this option, following a
":"
character (e\&.g\&.
"fd:\fIfoobar\fR")\&. If no name is specified, the name
"stdout"
is implied (i\&.e\&.
"fd"
is equivalent to
"fd:stdout")\&. At least one socket unit defining the specified name must be provided via the
\fISockets=\fR

\fIFileDescriptorName=\fR
in
\fBsystemd.socket\fR(5)
for more details about named descriptors and their ordering\&.
.sp
If the standard output (or error output, see below) of a unit is connected to the journal or the kernel log buffer, the unit will implicitly gain a dependency of type
\fIAfter=\fR
on
systemd\-journald\&.socket
(also see the "Implicit Dependencies" section above)\&. Also note that in this case stdout (or stderr, see below) will be an
\fBAF_UNIX\fR
stream socket, and not a pipe or FIFO that can be reopened\&. This means when executing shell scripts the construct
\fBecho "hello" > /dev/stderr\fR
for writing text to stderr will not work\&. To mitigate this use the construct
\fBecho "hello" >&2\fR
instead, which is mostly equivalent and avoids this pitfall\&.

\fIStandardInputData=\fR
accepts arbitrary binary data, encoded in
\m[blue]\fBBase64\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[14]\d\s+2\&. No escape sequences or specifiers are resolved\&. Any whitespace in the encoded version is ignored during decoding\&.

Run the unit\*(Aqs processes in the specified journal namespace\&. Expects a short user\-defined string identifying the namespace\&. If not used the processes of the service are run in the default journal namespace, i\&.e\&. their log stream is collected and processed by
systemd\-journald\&.service\&. If this option is used any log data generated by processes of this unit (regardless if via the

Internally, journal namespaces are implemented through Linux mount namespacing and over\-mounting the directory that contains the relevant
\fBAF_UNIX\fR
sockets used for logging in the unit\*(Aqs mount namespace\&. Since mount namespaces are used this setting disconnects propagation of mounts from the unit\*(Aqs processes to the host, similarly to how

\fILoadCredential=\fR\fIID\fR[:\fIPATH\fR], \fILoadCredentialEncrypted=\fR\fIID\fR[:\fIPATH\fR]
.RS 4
Pass a credential to the unit\&. Credentials are limited\-size binary or textual objects that may be passed to unit processes\&. They are primarily used for passing cryptographic keys (both public and private) or certificates, user account information or identity information from host to services\&. The data is accessible from the unit\*(Aqs processes via the file system, at a read\-only location that (if possible and permitted) is backed by non\-swappable memory\&. The data is only accessible to the user associated with the unit, via the
\fIUser=\fR/\fIDynamicUser=\fR
settings (as well as the superuser)\&. When available, the location of credentials is exported as the
\fI$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY\fR
environment variable to the unit\*(Aqs processes\&.
.sp
The
\fILoadCredential=\fR
setting takes a textual ID to use as name for a credential plus a file system path, separated by a colon\&. The ID must be a short ASCII string suitable as filename in the filesystem, and may be chosen freely by the user\&. If the specified path is absolute it is opened as regular file and the credential data is read from it\&. If the absolute path refers to an
\fBAF_UNIX\fR
stream socket in the file system a connection is made to it (only once at unit start\-up) and the credential data read from the connection, providing an easy IPC integration point for dynamically transferring credentials from other services\&.
.sp
If the specified path is not absolute and itself qualifies as valid credential identifier it is attempted to find a credential that the service manager itself received under the specified name \(em which may be used to propagate credentials from an invoking environment (e\&.g\&. a container manager that invoked the service manager) into a service\&. If no matching system credential is found, the directories
/etc/credstore/,
/run/credstore/
and
/usr/lib/credstore/
are searched for files under the credential\*(Aqs name \(em which hence are recommended locations for credential data on disk\&. If
\fILoadCredentialEncrypted=\fR
is used
/run/credstore\&.encrypted/,
/etc/credstore\&.encrypted/, and
/usr/lib/credstore\&.encrypted/
are searched as well\&.
.sp
If the file system path is omitted it is chosen identical to the credential name, i\&.e\&. this is a terse way to declare credentials to inherit from the service manager into a service\&. This option may be used multiple times, each time defining an additional credential to pass to the unit\&.
.sp
Note that if the path is not specified or a valid credential identifier is given, i\&.e\&. in the above two cases, a missing credential is not considered fatal\&.
.sp
If an absolute path referring to a directory is specified, every file in that directory (recursively) will be loaded as a separate credential\&. The ID for each credential will be the provided ID suffixed with
"_$FILENAME"
(e\&.g\&.,
"Key_file1")\&. When loading from a directory, symlinks will be ignored\&.
.sp
The contents of the file/socket may be arbitrary binary or textual data, including newline characters and
\fBNUL\fR
bytes\&.
.sp
The
\fILoadCredentialEncrypted=\fR
setting is identical to
\fILoadCredential=\fR, except that the credential data is decrypted and authenticated before being passed on to the executed processes\&. Specifically, the referenced path should refer to a file or socket with an encrypted credential, as implemented by
\fBsystemd-creds\fR(1)\&. This credential is loaded, decrypted, authenticated and then passed to the application in plaintext form, in the same way a regular credential specified via
\fILoadCredential=\fR
would be\&. A credential configured this way may be symmetrically encrypted/authenticated with a secret key derived from the system\*(Aqs TPM2 security chip, or with a secret key stored in
/var/lib/systemd/credentials\&.secret, or with both\&. Using encrypted and authenticated credentials improves security as credentials are not stored in plaintext and only authenticated and decrypted into plaintext the moment a service requiring them is started\&. Moreover, credentials may be bound to the local hardware and installations, so that they cannot easily be analyzed offline, or be generated externally\&. When
\fIDevicePolicy=\fR
is set to
"closed"
or
"strict", or set to
"auto"
and
\fIDeviceAllow=\fR
is set, or
\fIPrivateDevices=\fR
is set, then this setting adds
/dev/tpmrm0
with
\fBrw\fR
mode to
\fIDeviceAllow=\fR\&. See
\fBsystemd.resource-control\fR(5)
for the details about
\fIDevicePolicy=\fR
or
\fIDeviceAllow=\fR\&.
.sp
Note that encrypted credentials targeted for services of the per\-user service manager must be encrypted with
\fBsystemd\-creds encrypt \-\-user\fR, and those for the system service manager without the
\fB\-\-user\fR
switch\&. Encrypted credentials are always targeted to a specific user or the system as a whole, and it is ensured that per\-user service managers cannot decrypt secrets intended for the system or for other users\&.
.sp
The credential files/IPC sockets must be accessible to the service manager, but don\*(Aqt have to be directly accessible to the unit\*(Aqs processes: the credential data is read and copied into separate, read\-only copies for the unit that are accessible to appropriately privileged processes\&. This is particularly useful in combination with
\fIDynamicUser=\fR
as this way privileged data can be made available to processes running under a dynamic UID (i\&.e\&. not a previously known one) without having to open up access to all users\&.
.sp
In order to reference the path a credential may be read from within a
\fIExecStart=\fR
command line use
"${CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY}/mycred", e\&.g\&.
"ExecStart=cat ${CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY}/mycred"\&. In order to reference the path a credential may be read from within a
\fIEnvironment=\fR
line use
"%d/mycred", e\&.g\&.
"Environment=MYCREDPATH=%d/mycred"\&. For system services the path may also be referenced as
"/run/credentials/\fIUNITNAME\fR"
in cases where no interpolation is possible, e\&.g\&. configuration files of software that does not yet support credentials natively\&.
\fI$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY\fR
is considered the primary interface to look for credentials, though, since it also works for user services\&.
.sp
Currently, an accumulated credential size limit of 1 MB per unit is enforced\&.
.sp
The service manager itself may receive system credentials that can be propagated to services from a hosting container manager or VM hypervisor\&. See the
\m[blue]\fBContainer Interface\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[15]\d\s+2
documentation for details about the former\&. For the latter, pass
\m[blue]\fBDMI/SMBIOS\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[16]\d\s+2
OEM string table entries (field type 11) with a prefix of
"io\&.systemd\&.credential:"
or
"io\&.systemd\&.credential\&.binary:"\&. In both cases a key/value pair separated by
"="
is expected, in the latter case the right\-hand side is Base64 decoded when parsed (thus permitting binary data to be passed in)\&. Example
\m[blue]\fBqemu\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[17]\d\s+2
switch:
"\-smbios type=11,value=io\&.systemd\&.credential:xx=yy", or
"\-smbios type=11,value=io\&.systemd\&.credential\&.binary:rick=TmV2ZXIgR29ubmEgR2l2ZSBZb3UgVXA="\&. Alternatively, use the

node
"opt/io\&.systemd\&.credentials/"\&. Example
\fBqemu\fR
switch:
"\-fw_cfg name=opt/io\&.systemd\&.credentials/mycred,string=supersecret"\&. They may also be passed from the UEFI firmware environment via
\fBsystemd-stub\fR(7), from the initrd (see
\fBsystemd\fR(1)), or be specified on the kernel command line using the
"systemd\&.set_credential="
and
"systemd\&.set_credential_binary="

\fBsystemd\fR(1)
\(en this is not recommended since unprivileged userspace can read the kernel command line)\&.
.sp
If referencing an
\fBAF_UNIX\fR
stream socket to connect to, the connection will originate from an abstract namespace socket, that includes information about the unit and the credential ID in its socket name\&. Use

\fBNUL\fR
\fIRANDOM\fR
"/unit/"
\fIUNIT\fR
"/"
\fIID\fR, i\&.e\&. a
\fBNUL\fR
byte (as required for abstract namespace socket names), followed by a random string (consisting of alphadecimal characters), followed by the literal string
"/unit/", followed by the requesting unit name, followed by the literal character
"/", followed by the textual credential ID requested\&. Example:
"\e0adf9d86b6eda275e/unit/foobar\&.service/credx"

\fI$JOURNAL_STREAM\fR
.RS 4
If the standard output or standard error output of the executed processes are connected to the journal (for example, by setting
\fIStandardError=journal\fR)
\fI$JOURNAL_STREAM\fR
contains the device and inode numbers of the connection file descriptor, formatted in decimal, separated by a colon (":")\&. This permits invoked processes to safely detect whether their standard output or standard error output are connected to the journal\&. The device and inode numbers of the file descriptors should be compared with the values set in the environment variable to determine whether the process output is still connected to the journal\&. Note that it is generally not sufficient to only check whether
\fI$JOURNAL_STREAM\fR
is set at all as services might invoke external processes replacing their standard output or standard error output, without unsetting the environment variable\&.
.sp
If both standard output and standard error of the executed processes are connected to the journal via a stream socket, this environment variable will contain information about the standard error stream, as that\*(Aqs usually the preferred destination for log data\&. (Note that typically the same stream is used for both standard output and standard error, hence very likely the environment variable contains device and inode information matching both stream file descriptors\&.)
.sp
This environment variable is primarily useful to allow services to optionally upgrade their used log protocol to the native journal protocol (using
\fBsd_journal_print\fR(3)
