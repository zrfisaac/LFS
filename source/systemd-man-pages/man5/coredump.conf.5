.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
These files configure the behavior of
\fBsystemd-coredump\fR(8), a handler for core dumps invoked by the kernel\&. Whether
\fBsystemd\-coredump\fR
is used is determined by the kernel\*(Aqs
\fIkernel\&.core_pattern\fR
\fBsysctl\fR(8)
setting\&. See
\fBsystemd-coredump\fR(8)
and
\fBcore\fR(5)
pages for the details\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE"
.PP
The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from those defaults\&. The main configuration file is loaded from one of the listed directories in order of priority, only the first file found is used:
/etc/systemd/,
/run/systemd/,
/usr/local/lib/systemd/
\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2,
/usr/lib/systemd/\&. The vendor version of the file contains commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide to the administrator\&. Local overrides can also be created by creating drop\-ins, as described below\&. The main configuration file can also be edited for this purpose (or a copy in
/etc/
if it\*(Aqs shipped under
/usr/), however using drop\-ins for local configuration is recommended over modifications to the main configuration file\&.
.PP
In addition to the main configuration file, drop\-in configuration snippets are read from
/usr/lib/systemd/*\&.conf\&.d/,
/usr/local/lib/systemd/*\&.conf\&.d/, and
/etc/systemd/*\&.conf\&.d/\&. Those drop\-ins have higher precedence and override the main configuration file\&. Files in the
*\&.conf\&.d/
configuration subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the subdirectories they reside\&. When multiple files specify the same option, for options which accept just a single value, the entry in the file sorted last takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of values, entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files\&.
.PP
When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install drop\-ins under
/usr/\&. Files in
/etc/
are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files installed by vendor packages\&. Drop\-ins have to be used to override package drop\-ins, since the main configuration file has lower precedence\&. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a two\-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering\&. This also defines a concept of drop\-in priorities to allow OS vendors to ship drop\-ins within a specific range lower than the range used by users\&. This should lower the risk of package drop\-ins overriding accidentally drop\-ins defined by users\&. It is recommended to use the range 10\-40 for drop\-ins in
/usr/
and the range 60\-90 for drop\-ins in
/etc/
and
/run/, to make sure that local and transient drop\-ins take priority over drop\-ins shipped by the OS vendor\&.
.PP
To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to
/dev/null
in the configuration directory in
/etc/, with the same filename as the vendor configuration file\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
All options are configured in the [Coredump] section:
.PP
\fIStorage=\fR
.RS 4
Controls where to store cores\&. One of
"none",
"external", and
"journal"\&. When
"none", the core dumps may be logged (including the backtrace if possible), but not stored permanently\&. When
"external"
(the default), cores will be stored in
/var/lib/systemd/coredump/\&. When
"journal", cores will be stored in the journal and rotated following normal journal rotation patterns\&.
.sp
When cores are stored in the journal, they might be compressed following journal compression settings, see
\fBjournald.conf\fR(5)\&. When cores are stored externally, they will be compressed by default, see below\&.
.sp
Note that in order to process a coredump (i\&.e\&. extract a stack trace) the core must be written to disk first\&. Thus, unless
\fIProcessSizeMax=\fR
is set to 0 (see below), the core will be written to
/var/lib/systemd/coredump/
either way (under a temporary filename, or even in an unlinked file),
\fIStorage=\fR
thus only controls whether to leave it there even after it was processed\&.
.sp
Added in version 215\&.
.RE
.PP
\fICompress=\fR
.RS 4
Controls compression for external storage\&. Takes a boolean argument, which defaults to
"yes"\&.
.sp
Added in version 215\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIProcessSizeMax=\fR
.RS 4
The maximum size in bytes of a core which will be processed\&. Core dumps exceeding this size may be stored, but the stack trace will not be generated\&. Like other sizes in this same config file, the usual suffixes to the base of 1024 are allowed (B, K, M, G, T, P, and E)\&. Defaults to 1G on 32\-bit systems, 32G on 64\-bit systems\&.
.sp
Setting
\fIStorage=none\fR
and
\fIProcessSizeMax=0\fR
disables all coredump handling except for a log entry\&.
.sp
Added in version 215\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIExternalSizeMax=\fR, \fIJournalSizeMax=\fR
.RS 4
The maximum (compressed or uncompressed) size in bytes of a coredump to be saved in separate files on disk (default: 1G on 32\-bit systems, 32G on 64\-bit systems) or in the journal (default: 767M)\&. Note that the journal service enforces a hard limit on journal log records of 767M, and will ignore larger submitted log records\&. Hence,
\fIJournalSizeMax=\fR
may be lowered relative to the default, but not increased\&. Unit suffixes are allowed just as in
\fBProcessSizeMax=\fR\&.
.sp
\fIExternalSizeMax=infinity\fR
sets the core size to unlimited\&.
.sp
Added in version 215\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIMaxUse=\fR, \fIKeepFree=\fR
.RS 4
Enforce limits on the disk space, specified in bytes, taken up by externally stored core dumps\&. Unit suffixes are allowed just as in
\fBProcessSizeMax=\fR\&.
\fBMaxUse=\fR
makes sure that old core dumps are removed as soon as the total disk space taken up by core dumps grows beyond this limit (defaults to 10% of the total disk size)\&.
\fBKeepFree=\fR
controls how much disk space to keep free at least (defaults to 15% of the total disk size)\&. Note that the disk space used by core dumps might temporarily exceed these limits while core dumps are processed\&. Note that old core dumps are also removed based on time via
\fBsystemd-tmpfiles\fR(8)\&. Set either value to 0 to turn off size\-based cleanup\&.
.sp
Added in version 215\&.
.RE
.PP
The defaults for all values are listed as comments in the template
/etc/systemd/coredump\&.conf
file that is installed by default\&.

ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥ðŸ§¨ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’£ Please note that those configuration files must be available at all times. If
/usr/local/
is a separate partition, it may not be available during early boot, and must not be used for configuration.
