.SH "NAME"
systemd.network \- Network configuration
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fInetwork\fR\&.network
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
A plain ini\-style text file that encodes network configuration for matching network interfaces, used by
\fBsystemd-networkd\fR(8)\&. See
\fBsystemd.syntax\fR(7)
for a general description of the syntax\&.
.PP
The main network file must have the extension
\&.network; other extensions are ignored\&. Networks are applied to links whenever the links appear\&.
.PP
The
\&.network
files are read from the files located in the system network directories
/usr/lib/systemd/network
and
/usr/local/lib/systemd/network
\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2, the volatile runtime network directory
/run/systemd/network
and the local administration network directory
/etc/systemd/network\&. All configuration files are collectively sorted and processed in alphanumeric order, regardless of the directories in which they live\&. However, files with identical filenames replace each other\&. It is recommended that each filename is prefixed with a number smaller than
"70"
(e\&.g\&.
10\-eth0\&.network)\&. Otherwise, the default
\&.network
files or those generated by
\fBsystemd-network-generator.service\fR(8)
may take precedence over user configured files\&. Files in
/etc/
have the highest priority, files in
/run/
take precedence over files with the same name under
/usr/\&. This can be used to override a system\-supplied configuration file with a local file if needed\&. As a special case, an empty file (file size 0) or symlink with the same name pointing to
/dev/null
disables the configuration file entirely (it is "masked")\&.
.PP
Along with the network file
foo\&.network, a "drop\-in" directory
foo\&.network\&.d/
may exist\&. All files with the suffix
"\&.conf"
from this directory will be merged in the alphanumeric order and parsed after the main file itself has been parsed\&. This is useful to alter or add configuration settings, without having to modify the main configuration file\&. Each drop\-in file must have appropriate section headers\&.
.PP
In addition to
/etc/systemd/network, drop\-in
"\&.d"
directories can be placed in
/usr/lib/systemd/network
or
/run/systemd/network
directories\&. Drop\-in files in
/etc/
take precedence over those in
/run/
which in turn take precedence over those in
/usr/lib/\&. Drop\-in files under any of these directories take precedence over the main network file wherever located\&.
.SH "[MATCH] SECTION OPTIONS"
.PP
The network file contains a [Match] section, which determines if a given network file may be applied to a given interface; and a [Network] section specifying how the interface should be configured\&. The first (in alphanumeric order) of the network files that matches a given interface is applied, all later files are ignored, even if they match as well\&.
.PP
Note that any network interfaces that have the
\fIID_NET_MANAGED_BY=\fR
udev property set will never be matched by any \&.network files \(en unless the property\*(Aqs value is the string
"io\&.systemd\&.Network"
\(en even if the [Match] section would otherwise match\&. This may be used to exclude specific network interfaces from
\fBsystemd\-networkd\fR\*(Aqs management, while keeping the [Match] section generic\&. The
\fIID_NET_MANAGED_BY=\fR
property thus declares intended
\fIownership\fR
of the device, and permits ensuring that concurrent network management implementations do not compete for management of specific devices\&.
.PP
A network file is said to match a network interface if all matches specified by the [Match] section are satisfied\&. When a network file does not contain valid settings in [Match] section, then the file will match all interfaces and
\fBsystemd\-networkd\fR
warns about that\&. Hint: to avoid the warning and to make it clear that all interfaces shall be matched, add the following:

Both "search" and "routing\-only" domains are used for routing of DNS queries: look\-ups for hostnames ending in those domains (hence also single label names, if any "search domains" are listed), are routed to the DNS servers configured for this interface\&.
