.SH "NAME"
systemd.netdev \- Virtual Network Device configuration
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fInetdev\fR\&.netdev
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
A plain ini\-style text file that encodes configuration about a virtual network device, used by
\fBsystemd-networkd\fR(8)\&. See
\fBsystemd.syntax\fR(7)
for a general description of the syntax\&.
.PP
The main Virtual Network Device file must have the extension
\&.netdev; other extensions are ignored\&. Virtual network devices are created as soon as networkd is started\&. If a netdev with the specified name already exists, networkd will use that as\-is rather than create its own\&. Note that the settings of the pre\-existing netdev will not be changed by networkd\&.
.PP
The
\&.netdev
files are read from the files located in the system network directory
/usr/lib/systemd/network
and
/usr/local/lib/systemd/network, the volatile runtime network directory
/run/systemd/network
and the local administration network directory
/etc/systemd/network\&. All configuration files are collectively sorted and processed in alphanumeric order, regardless of the directories in which they live\&. However, files with identical filenames replace each other\&. It is recommended that each filename is prefixed with a number smaller than
"70"
(e\&.g\&.
10\-vlan\&.netdev)\&. Otherwise,
\&.netdev
files generated by
\fBsystemd-network-generator.service\fR(8)
may take precedence over user configured files\&. Files in
/etc/
have the highest priority, files in
/run/
take precedence over files with the same name in
/usr/lib/\&. This can be used to override a system\-supplied configuration file with a local file if needed\&. As a special case, an empty file (file size 0) or symlink with the same name pointing to
/dev/null
disables the configuration file entirely (it is "masked")\&.
.PP
Along with the netdev file
foo\&.netdev, a "drop\-in" directory
foo\&.netdev\&.d/
may exist\&. All files with the suffix
"\&.conf"
from this directory will be merged in the alphanumeric order and parsed after the main file itself has been parsed\&. This is useful to alter or add configuration settings, without having to modify the main configuration file\&. Each drop\-in file must have appropriate section headers\&.
.PP
In addition to
/etc/systemd/network, drop\-in
"\&.d"
directories can be placed in
/usr/lib/systemd/network
or
/run/systemd/network
directories\&. Drop\-in files in
/etc/
take precedence over those in
/run/
which in turn take precedence over those in
/usr/lib/\&. Drop\-in files under any of these directories take precedence over the main netdev file wherever located\&. (Of course, since
/run/
is temporary and
/usr/lib/
is for vendors, it is unlikely drop\-ins should be used in either of those places\&.)

\fIPartitionKey=\fR

.PP
\fIMode=\fR
.RS 4
Takes one of the special values
"datagram"
or
"connected"\&. Defaults to unset, and the kernel\*(Aqs default is used\&.
.sp
When
"datagram", the Infiniband unreliable datagram (UD) transport is used, and so the interface MTU is equal to the IB L2 MTU minus the IPoIB encapsulation header (4 bytes)\&. For example, in a typical IB fabric with a 2K MTU, the IPoIB MTU will be 2048 \- 4 = 2044 bytes\&.
.sp
When
"connected", the Infiniband reliable connected (RC) transport is used\&. Connected mode takes advantage of the connected nature of the IB transport and allows an MTU up to the maximal IP packet size of 64K, which reduces the number of IP packets needed for handling large UDP datagrams, TCP segments, etc and increases the performance for large messages\&.
