.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
At boot,
\fBsystemd-binfmt.service\fR(8)
reads configuration files from the above directories to register in the kernel additional binary formats for executables\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION FORMAT"
.PP
Each file contains a list of binfmt_misc kernel binary format rules\&. Consult the kernel\*(Aqs
\m[blue]\fBKernel Support for miscellaneous Binary Formats (binfmt_misc)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
documentation file for more information on registration of additional binary formats and how to write rules\&.
.PP
Empty lines and lines beginning with
";"
and
"#"
are ignored\&. Note that this means you may not use those symbols as the delimiter in binary format rules\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE"
.PP
Configuration files are read from directories in
/etc/,
/run/,
/usr/local/lib/, and
/usr/lib/, in order of precedence, as listed in the SYNOPSIS section above\&. Files must have the
"\&.conf"
extension\&. Files in
/etc/
override files with the same name in
/run/,
/usr/local/lib/, and
/usr/lib/\&. Files in
/run/
override files with the same name under
/usr/\&.
.PP
All configuration files are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of which of the directories they reside in\&. If multiple files specify the same option, the entry in the file with the lexicographically latest name will take precedence\&. Thus, the configuration in a certain file may either be replaced completely (by placing a file with the same name in a directory with higher priority), or individual settings might be changed (by specifying additional settings in a file with a different name that is ordered later)\&.
.PP
Packages should install their configuration files in
/usr/lib/
(distribution packages) or
/usr/local/lib/
(local installs)
\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2\&. Files in
/etc/
are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files installed by vendor packages\&.
.PP
It is recommended to prefix all filenames with a two\-digit number and a dash to simplify the ordering\&. It is recommended to use the range 10\-40 for configuration files in
/usr/
and the range 60\-90 for configuration files in
/etc/
and
/run/, to make sure that local and transient configuration files will always take priority over configuration files shipped by the OS vendor\&.
.PP
If the administrator wants to disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to
/dev/null
in the configuration directory in
/etc/, with the same filename as the vendor configuration file\&. If the vendor configuration file is included in the initrd image, the image has to be regenerated\&.

ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥ðŸ§¨ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’£ Please note that those configuration files must be available at all times. If
/usr/local/
is a separate partition, it may not be available during early boot, and must not be used for configuration.
