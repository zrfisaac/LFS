    Description: provides an interface to GCC, essentially convert the
                 internal quadruples of m2f into a GCC tree structure.

(*
   ConvertQuadsToTree - runs through the quadruple list, Start..End, and converts it into
                        the GCC tree structure.
*)

PROCEDURE ConvertQuadsToTree (Start, End: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   ResolveConstantExpressions - resolves constant expressions from the quadruple list.
                                It returns TRUE if one or more constants were folded.
                                When a constant symbol value is solved, the call back
                                p(sym) is invoked.
*)

PROCEDURE ResolveConstantExpressions (p: WalkAction; start, end: CARDINAL) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   GetHighFromUnbounded - returns a Tree containing the value of
                          param.HIGH.
*)

PROCEDURE GetHighFromUnbounded (location: location_t; dim, param: CARDINAL) : Tree ;


(*
   StringToChar - if type=Char and str is a string (of size <= 1)
                  then convert the string into a character constant.
*)

PROCEDURE StringToChar (t: Tree; type, str: CARDINAL) : Tree ;


(*
   LValueToGenericPtr - returns a Tree representing symbol, sym.
                        It coerces a lvalue into an internal pointer type
*)

PROCEDURE LValueToGenericPtr (location: location_t; sym: CARDINAL) : Tree ;


(*
   ZConstToTypedConst - checks whether op1 and op2 are constants and
                        coerces, t, appropriately.
*)

PROCEDURE ZConstToTypedConst (t: Tree; op1, op2: CARDINAL) : Tree ;


(*
   PrepareCopyString - returns two trees:
                       length    number of bytes to be copied (including the nul if room)
                       srcTreeType the new string type (with the extra nul character).

                       Pre condition:  destStrType the dest type string.
                                       src is the original string (without a nul)
                                       to be copied.
                       Post condition: TRUE or FALSE is returned.
                                       if true length and srcTreeType will be assigned
                                       else length is set to the maximum length to be
                                            copied and srcTree is set to the max length
                                            which fits in dest.
*)
