        This book is divided into the following fourteen parts.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Part I - Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        This part contains essential information which is needed to
        understand the rest of the book.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Part II - Post LFS Configuration and Extra Software
      </h2>
      <p>
        Here we introduce basic configuration and security issues. We also
        discuss a range of text editors, file systems, and shells which
        aren't covered in the main LFS book.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Part III - General Libraries and Utilities
      </h2>
      <p>
        In this section we cover libraries which are often needed throughout
        the book, as well as system utilities. Information on programming
        (including recompiling <span class="application">GCC</span> to
        support its full range of languages) concludes this part.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Part IV - Basic Networking
      </h2>
      <p>
        Here we explain how to connect to a network when you aren't using the
        simple static IP setup presented in the main LFS book. Networking
        libraries and command-line networking tools are also covered here.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Part V - Servers
      </h2>
      <p>
        Here we show you how to set up mail and other servers (such as
        <span class="application">FTP</span>, <span class=
        "application">Apache</span>, etc.).
      </p>
      <h2>
        Part VI - X + Window Managers
      </h2>
      <p>
        This part explains how to set up a basic <span class="application">X
        Window System</span>, along with some generic <span class=
        "application">X</span> libraries and Window managers.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Part VII - KDE
      </h2>
      <p>
        This part is for those who want to use the <span class=
        "application">K Desktop Environment</span>, or parts of it.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Part VIII - GNOME
      </h2>
      <p>
        <span class="application">GNOME</span> is the main alternative to
        <span class="application">KDE</span> in the Desktop Environment
        arena.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Part IX - Xfce
      </h2>
      <p>
        <span class="application">Xfce</span> is a lightweight alternative to
        <span class="application">GNOME</span> and <span class=
        "application">KDE</span>.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Part X - LXQt
      </h2>
      <p>
        <span class="application">LXDE</span> is another lightweight
        alternative to <span class="application">GNOME</span> and
        <span class="application">KDE</span>.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Part XI - More X Software
      </h2>
      <p>
        Office programs and graphical web browsers are important to most
        people. They, and some generic <span class="application">X</span>
        software, can be found in this part of the book.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Part XII - Multimedia
      </h2>
      <p>
        Here we cover multimedia libraries and drivers, along with some
        audio, video, and CD-writing programs.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Part XIII - Printing, Scanning and Typesetting (PST)
      </h2>
      <p>
        This part covers document handling, from applications like
        <span class="application">Ghostscript</span>, <span class=
        "application">CUPS</span>, and <span class=
        "application">DocBook</span>, all the way to <span class=
        "application">texlive</span>.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Appendices
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Appendices present information which doesn't belong in the body
        of book; they are included as reference material. The glossary of
        acronyms is a handy feature.
