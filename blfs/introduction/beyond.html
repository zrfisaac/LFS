        The packages that are installed in this book are only the tip of the
        iceberg. We hope that the experience you gained with the LFS book and
        the BLFS book will give you the background needed to compile, install
        and configure packages that are not included in this book.

      <p>
        When you want to install a package to a location other than
        <code class="filename">/</code>, or <code class=
        "filename">/usr</code>, you are installing outside the default
        environment settings on most machines. The following examples should
        assist you in determining how to correct this situation. The examples
        cover the complete range of settings that may need updating, but they
        are not all needed in every situation.

        <ul>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>
              Many of the newer packages follow the <span class=
              "command"><strong>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make
              install</strong></span> process. Help on the options accepted
              by configure can be obtained via the command <span class=

          <li class="listitem">
            <p>
              Most of the packages contain documentation on compiling and
              installing the package. Some of the documents are excellent,
              some not so excellent. Check out the homepage of the package
              for any additional and updated hints for compiling and
              configuring the package.

          <li class="listitem">
            <p>
              If you are having a problem compiling the package, try
              searching the LFS archives at <a class="ulink" href=
              "https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/search.html">https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/search.html</a>
              for the error or if that fails, try searching Google. Often, a
              distribution will have already solved the problem (many of them
              use development versions of packages, so they see the changes
              sooner than those of us who normally use stable released
              versions). But be cautious - all builders tend to carry patches
              which are no longer necessary, and to have fixes which are only
              required because of their particular choices in how they build
              a package. You may have to search deeply to find a fix for the
              package version you are trying to use, or even to find the
              package (names are sometimes not what you might expect, e.g.
              <span class="application">ghostscript</span> often has a prefix
              or a suffix in its name), but the following notes might help,
              particularly for those who, like the editors, are trying to
              build the latest versions and encountering problems:

                    accompanied by versioned .diff.gz or .tar.gz additions.
                    These additions often show how the package is built, and
                    may contain patches. In the .diff.gz versions, any

                    search box. If the package is found you can look at the
                    files (specfile to control the build, various patches) or
                    the commits. If that fails, you can download an srpm
                    (source rpm) and using <span class=

                    and then choose which repo you wish to look at -
                    development/rawhide is the latest development, or choose
                    releases for what was shipped in a release, updates for
                    updates to a release, or updates/testing for the latest

                    Gentoo - First use a search engine to find an ebuild
                    which looks as if it will fix the problem, or search at
                    <a class="ulink" href=
                    "https://packages.gentoo.org/">https://packages.gentoo.org/</a>
                    - use the search field. Note where the package lives in
                    the portage hierarchy, e.g. <code class=
                    "filename">app-something/</code>. In general you can
                    treat the ebuild as a sort of pseudo-code / shell
                    combination with some functions you can hazard a guess
                    at, such as <span class=
                    "command"><strong>dodoc</strong></span>. If the fix is
                    just a <span class="command"><strong>sed</strong></span>,
                    try it. However, in most cases the fix will use a patch.
                    To find the patch, use a gentoo-portage mirror: Two links
                    to mirrors in the U.S.A. which seem to usually be up to
                    date are <a class="ulink" href=
                    "https://mirror.rackspace.com/gentoo-portage/">https://mirror.rackspace.com/gentoo-portage/</a>
                    and <a class="ulink" href=
                    "https://mirror.steadfast.net/gentoo-portage/">https://mirror.steadfast.net/gentoo-portage/</a>.
                    Navigate down the tree to the package, then to the
                    <code class="filename">files/</code> directory to look
                    for the patch. Sometimes a portage mirror has not yet
                    been updated, particularly for a recent new patch. In a
                    few cases, gentoo batch the patches into a tarball and
                    the ebuild will have a link in the form
                    https://dev.gentoo.org/~${PATCH_DEV}/distfiles/${P}-patches-${PATCH_VER}.tar.xz
                    here, look for PATCH_DEV and PATCH_VER in the build and
                    format the full URL in your browser or for wget. Remember
                    the '~' before the developer's ID and note that trying to
                    search the earlier levels of the URL in a browser may
                    drop you at www.gentoo.org or return 403 (forbidden).

        <p>
          If you have found a package that is only available in <code class=
          "filename">.deb</code> or <code class="filename">.rpm</code>
          format, there are two small scripts, <span class=
          "command"><strong>rpm2targz</strong></span> and <span class=
          "command"><strong>deb2targz</strong></span> that are available at
          <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://anduin.linuxfromscratch.org/BLFS/extras/deb2targz.tar.bz2">
          https://anduin.linuxfromscratch.org/BLFS/extras/deb2targz.tar.bz2</a>
          and <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://anduin.linuxfromscratch.org/BLFS/extras/rpm2targz.tar.bz2">
          https://anduin.linuxfromscratch.org/BLFS/extras/rpm2targz.tar.bz2</a>
          to convert the archives into a simple <code class=
          "filename">tar.gz</code> format.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may also find an rpm2cpio script useful. The Perl version in
          the linux kernel archives at <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://lore.kernel.org/all/20021016121842.GA2292@ncsu.edu/2-rpm2cpio">
          https://lore.kernel.org/all/20021016121842.GA2292@ncsu.edu/2-rpm2cpio</a>
          works for most source rpms. The rpm2targz script will use an
          rpm2cpio script or binary if one is on your path. Note that
          rpm2cpio will unpack a source rpm in the current directory, giving
          a tarball, a spec file, and perhaps patches or other files.
