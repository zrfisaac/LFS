        Unlike the Linux From Scratch book, BLFS isn't designed to be
        followed in a linear manner. LFS provides instructions on how to
        create a base system which can become anything from a web server to a
        multimedia desktop system. BLFS attempts to guide you in the process
        of going from the base system to your intended destination. Choice is
        very much involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone who reads this book will want to read certain sections. The
        <a class="xref" href="introduction.html" title=
        "Part&nbsp;I.&nbsp;Introduction">Introduction</a>, which you are
        currently reading, contains generic information. Take special note of
        the information in <a class="xref" href="important.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Important Information">Chapter&nbsp;2,
        Important Information</a>, as this contains comments about how to
        unpack software, issues related to the use of different locales, and
        various other considerations which apply throughout the book.
      </p>
      <p>
        The part on <a class="xref" href="../postlfs/postlfs.html" title=
        "Part&nbsp;II.&nbsp;Post LFS Configuration and Extra Software">Post
        LFS Configuration and Extra Software</a> is where most people will
        want to turn next. This deals not only with configuration, but also
        with Security (<a class="xref" href="../postlfs/security.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Security">Chapter&nbsp;4, Security</a>), File
        Systems (<a class="xref" href="../postlfs/filesystems.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;File Systems and Disk Management">Chapter&nbsp;5,
        File Systems and Disk Management</a> -- including GRUB for UEFI),
        Text Editors (<a class="xref" href="../postlfs/editors.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Text Editors">Chapter&nbsp;6, Text
        Editors</a>), and Shells (<a class="xref" href=
        "../postlfs/shells.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Shells">Chapter&nbsp;7, Shells</a>). Indeed,
        you may wish to reference some parts of this chapter (especially the
        sections on Text Editors and File Systems) while building your LFS
        system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following these basic items, most people will want to at least browse
        through the <a class="xref" href="../general/general.html" title=
        "Part&nbsp;III.&nbsp;General Libraries and Utilities">General
        Libraries and Utilities</a> part of the book. This contains
        information on many items which are prerequisites for other sections
        of the book, as well as some items (such as <a class="xref" href=
        "../general/prog.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;13.&nbsp;Programming">Chapter&nbsp;13, Programming</a>)
        which are useful in their own right. You don't have to install all of
        the libraries and packages found in this part; each BLFS installation
        procedure tells you which other packages this one depends upon. You
        can choose the program you want to install, and see what it needs.
        (Don't forget to check for nested dependencies!)
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, most people will probably want to look at the <a class=
        "xref" href="../basicnet/basicnet.html" title=
        "Part&nbsp;IV.&nbsp;Networking">Networking</a> section. It deals with
        connecting to the Internet or your LAN (<a class="xref" href=
        "../basicnet/connect.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;14.&nbsp;Connecting to a Network">Chapter&nbsp;14,
        Connecting to a Network</a>) using a variety of methods such as DHCP
        and PPP, and with items such as Networking Libraries (<a class="xref"
        href="../basicnet/netlibs.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;17.&nbsp;Networking Libraries">Chapter&nbsp;17,
        Networking Libraries</a>), plus various basic networking programs and
        utilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have dealt with these basics, you may wish to configure more
        advanced network services. These are dealt with in the <a class=
        "xref" href="../server/server.html" title=
        "Part&nbsp;V.&nbsp;Servers">Servers</a> part of the book. Those
        wanting to build servers should find a good starting point there.
        Note that this section also contains information on several database
        packages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next twelve chapters deal with desktop systems. This portion of
        the book starts with a part talking about <a class="xref" href=
        "../x/x.html" title=
        "Part&nbsp;VI.&nbsp;Graphical Components">Graphical Components</a>.
        This part also deals with some generic X-based libraries (<a class=
        "xref" href="../x/lib.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;25.&nbsp;Graphical Environment Libraries">Chapter&nbsp;25,
        Graphical Environment Libraries</a>). After that, <a class="xref"
        href="../kde/kde.html" title="Part&nbsp;VII.&nbsp;KDE">KDE</a>,
        <a class="xref" href="../gnome/gnome.html" title=
        "Part&nbsp;VIII.&nbsp;GNOME">GNOME</a>, <a class="xref" href=
        "../xfce/xfce.html" title="Part&nbsp;IX.&nbsp;Xfce">Xfce</a>, and
        <a class="xref" href="../lxqt/lxqt.html" title=
        "Part&nbsp;X.&nbsp;LXQt">LXQt</a> are given their own parts, followed
        by one on <a class="xref" href="../xsoft/xsoft.html" title=
        "Part&nbsp;XI.&nbsp;X Software">X Software</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The book then moves on to deal with <a class="xref" href=
        "../multimedia/multimedia.html" title=
        "Part&nbsp;XII.&nbsp;Multimedia">Multimedia</a> packages. Note that
        many people may want to use the <a class="xref" href=
        "../multimedia/alsa.html" title="ALSA">ALSA</a> instructions from
        this chapter when first starting their BLFS journey; the instructions
        are placed here because it is the most logical place for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final part of the main BLFS book deals with <a class="xref" href=
        "../pst/pst.html" title=
        "Part&nbsp;XIII.&nbsp;Printing, Scanning and Typesetting">Printing,
        Scanning and Typesetting</a>. This is useful for most people with
        desktop systems, but even those who are creating dedicated server
        systems may find it useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope you enjoy using BLFS. May you realize your dream of building
        the perfectly personalized Linux system!
