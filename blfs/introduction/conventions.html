          Conventions Used for Package Dependencies
        </h2>
        <p>
          When new packages are created, the software's authors depend on
          prior work. In order to build a package in BLFS, these dependencies
          must be built before the desired package can be compiled. For each
          package, prerequisites are listed in one or more separate sections:
          Required, Recommended, and Optional.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Required Dependencies
        </h3>
        <p>
          These dependencies are the bare minimum needed to build the
          package. Packages in LFS, and the required dependencies of these
          required packages, are omitted from this list. Always remember to
          check for nested dependencies. If a dependency is said to be
          <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">runtime,</span>”</span> it
          is not needed for building the package, but only to use it after
          installation.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Recommended Dependencies
        </h3>
        <p>
          These are dependencies the BLFS editors have determined are
          important to give the package reasonable capabilities. If a
          recommended dependency is not said to be <span class=
          "quote">“<span class="quote">runtime,</span>”</span> package
          installation instructions assume it is installed. If it is not
          installed, the instructions may require modification, to
          accommodate the missing package. A recommended <span class=
          "quote">“<span class="quote">runtime</span>”</span> dependency does
          not need to be installed before building the package, but must be
          built afterwards for running the package with reasonable
          capabilities.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Optional Dependencies
        </h3>
        <p>
          These are dependencies the package <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>may</em></span> use. Integration of optional
          dependencies may be automatic by the package, or additional steps
          not presented by BLFS may be necessary. Optional dependencies are
          sometimes listed without explicit BLFS instructions. In this case
          you must determine how to perform the installation yourself.

          Conventions Used for Kernel Configuration Options
        </h2>
        <p>
          Some packages require specific kernel configuration options. The
          general layout for these looks like this:

          Note that, depending on other selections, the angle brackets
          (&lt;&gt;) in the configuration menu may appear as braces ({}) if
          the option cannot be unselected, or even as dashes (-*- or -M-),
          when the choice is imposed. The help text describing the option
          specifies the other selections on which this option relies, and how
          those other selections are set.

          SBU values in BLFS
        </h2>
        <p>
          As in LFS, each package in BLFS has a build time listed in Standard
          Build Units (SBUs). These times are relative to the time it took to
          build binutils in LFS, and are intended to provide some insight
          into how long it will take to build a package. Most times listed
          are for a single processor or core to build the package. In some
          cases, large, long running builds tested on multi-core systems have
          SBU times listed with comments such as '(parallelism=4)'. These
          values indicate testing was done using multiple cores. Note that
          while this speeds up the build on systems with the appropriate
          hardware, the speedup is not linear and to some extent depends on
          the individual package and the specific hardware used.
        </p>
        <p>
          For packages which use ninja (i.e., anything using meson) or rust,
          by default all cores are used; similar comments will be seen on
          such packages even when the build time is minimal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where even a parallel build takes more than 15 SBU, on certain
          machines the time may be considerably greater even when the build
          does not use swap. In particular, different micro-architectures
          will build some files at different relative speeds, and this can
          introduce delays when certain make targets wait for another file to
          be created. Where a large build uses a lot of C++ files, processors
          with Simultaneous Multi Threading will share the Floating Point
          Unit and can take 45% longer than when using four 'prime' cores
          (measured on an intel i7 using taskset and keeping the other cores
          idle).
        </p>
        <p>
          Some packages do not support parallel builds; for these, the make
          command must specify -j1. Packages that are known to impose such
          limits are so marked in the text.
